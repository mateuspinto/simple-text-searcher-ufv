Chorus  
You gotta keep it pumpin x4  
  
Verse One Tamika  
I went out looking for a good place  
But everywhere I went was dull  
I went here and I went there  
But I never found the stuff  
But then I met this boy that said  
He had the perfect place  
That I would just love yeah  
He took me in  
Ooh let me tell you girlfriend  
The place was jumping  
And it was sho nuff pumpin  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Verse Two Kandi  
I found my spot  
Nothing about the place seemed dull  
And the stuff I was looking for  
I found the stuff  
The sound was hot like I never heard before  
The bass was booming  
There were people all over the dance floor  
Then I met another guy  
And he asked me would I like to dance  
He showed me steps I never seen before  
I walked in  
Ooh let me tell you girlfriend  
The place was jumping  
And it was sho nuff pumpin  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Thats the way I like it  
I like it when its pumpin  
repeat x4  
  
Outro by JD  
If you got a groove that you like and you like it a lot  
Pump it up pump it up  
You know the place with the bass  
In the neighbourhood hot spot  
Pump it up pump it up  
To the girl in the blue  
Tell me what cha gonna do  
Pump it up pump it up  
And to the negro in red tell me what I said  
Pump it up pump it up  
  
Repeat Chorus to fade
