Love in a vacuum love in a space  
Love without even the little hint of a trace  
Love in confusion then love doesnt show on your face  
  
Love is a stranger love is a box  
Love is the key that fits a million locks  
Love is a mystery when love is the devil you call  
  
Put your heart and soul where I can see them shine  
I wish youd put your heart and soul where I can think theyre mine  
I wish youd put your heart and soul where I can see them shine  
  
Love at a distance love at a walk  
Love at the limit if only people could talk  
Love for the moment it takes to its wings like a hawk  
  
Love for tomorrow love for today  
Love for the hour it could be coming your way  
Love for a puzzle you need a solution to play  
  
Put your heart and soul where I can see them shine  
I wish youd put your heart and soul where I can think theyre mine  
I wish youd put your heart and soul where I can see them shine  
I wish youd put your heart and soul where I can think theyre mine  
  
I wish youd put your heart and soul where I can see them shine  
I wish youd put your heart and soul where I can think theyre mine  
I wish youd put your heart and soul where I can see them shine  
I wish youd put your heart and soul where I can think theyre mine  
I wish youd put your heart and soul where I can see them shine  
I wish youd put your heart and soul where I can think theyre mine
