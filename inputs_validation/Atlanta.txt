She lives in a bungalow  
She kills me with rosegarden thorns  
She waits for me  
My love is unusual  
Its painted with roses and thorns  
with her Im complete  
  
She lives by the wall  
and waits by the door  
She walks in the sun  
to me  
  
Visions of Mexico seduce me  
It goes to my head so carefully  
Memories of candles and incense  
And all of these things remember these  
  
She lives by the wall  
and waits by the door  
She walks in the sun  
to me  
  
She comforts me when  
the candles blow out  
the cake has grown mold  
but the memories are sweet  
The laughters all gone  
but the memories are mine  
The Mexican princess  
is out of my life  
  
She lives by the wall  
and waits by the door  
She walks in the sun  
to me
