I cant seem to make up my mind  
I cant tell the colors  
That will fit this room  
I cant tell a thing about you  
Make up my mind  
  
I cant seem to make up my mind  
Are you laughing at me  
Or telling a joke  
The cigarette on the sheet  
Begins to smoke  
Make up your mind  
  
Right or left up or down  
In or out straight or round  
Love or lust rain or shine  
I cant seem to make up my poor mind  
  
I cant seem to make up my mind  
I cant tell the difference between wrong and right  
Are you laughing at me in your sleep tonight  
  
Leaving me behind  
Leaving me behind  
Why dont you make up your mind  
I cant seem to make up my mind  
About leaving me baby  
I cant seem to make up my mind  
I cant seem to make up my mind  
I cant seem to make up my mind
