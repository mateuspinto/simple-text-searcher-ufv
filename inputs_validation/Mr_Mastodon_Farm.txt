Then they flap their wings at the last second  
  
You see birds fall from the window ledge above mine  
  
Then they flap their wings at the last second  
  
I can see their dead weight  
  
Just dropping like stones  
  
For small loaves of bread  
  
Past my window all the time  
  
But unless I get up  
  
Walk across the room  
  
And peer down below  
  
I dont see their last second curves  
  
Toward a horizontal flight  
  
All these birds just falling from the ledge like stones  
  
Now due to a construct in my mind  
  
That makes their falling and their flight  
  
Symbolic of my entire existence  
  
It becomes important for me  
  
To get up and see  
  
Their last second curves toward flight  
  
Its almost as if my life will fall  
  
Unless I see their ascent
