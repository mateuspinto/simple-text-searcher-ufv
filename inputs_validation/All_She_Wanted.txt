She was a good girl  
Been true to herself  
Never swayed by the notions of somebody else  
Shed had it rough maybe most of the time  
With only one thing on her mind  
  
All she wanted was a lovin man  
All she wanted was a lovin man  
Who was tryin to do the best that he can  
All she wanted was a lovin lovin man  
  
There could be blue skies in her heart  
She was waitin for the good times to start  
She never wanted diamonds  
She never wanted gold  
She was holdin out for someone to hold  
  
All she wanted was a lovin man  
All she wanted was a lovin man  
Who was tryin to do the best that he can  
All she wanted was a lovin lovin man  
  
A loving man  
All she wanted was a lovin man  
  
All she wanted was a lovin man  
All she wanted was a lovin man  
Who was tryin to do the best that he can  
All she wanted was a lovin lovin man  
  
Loving man  
All she wanted was a lovin man  
All she wanted was a lovin man  
All she wanted was a lovin man  
All she wanted was a lovin man
