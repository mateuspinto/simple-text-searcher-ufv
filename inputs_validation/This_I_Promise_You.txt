When the visions around you  
Bring tears to your eyes  
And all that surrounds you  
Are secrets and lies  
Ill be your strength  
Ill give you hope  
Keeping your faith when its gone  
The one you should call  
Was standing here all alone  
Chorus  
And I will take you in my arms  
And hold you right were you belong  
Til the day my life is through  
This I promise you  
This I promise you  
Ive loved you forever  
In lifetimes before  
And I promise you never  
Will you hurt anymore  
I give you my word  
I give you my heart  
This is a battle weve won  
And with this vow  
Forever has now begun  
Just close your eyes  
Each lovin day  
And know this feeling wont go away  
Til the day my life is through  
This I promise you  
Over and over I fall  
When I hear you call  
Without you in my life baby  
I just wouldnt be living at all  
Chorus  
And I will take you in my arms  
And hold you right were you belong  
Til the day my life is through  
This I promise you baby  
Just close your eyes  
Each lovin day  
And know this feeling wont go away  
Every word I say is true  
This I promise you  
I promise you
