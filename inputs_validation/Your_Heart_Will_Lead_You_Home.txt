Sunny days and starry nights  
And lazy afternoons  
Youre counting castles in the clouds  
And humming little tunes  
  
But somehow right before your eyes  
The summer fades away  
Everything is different  
And everything has changed  
  
If you feel lost and on your own  
And far from home  
Youre never alone you know  
  
Just think of your friends  
The ones who care  
They all will be waiting there  
With love to share  
And your heart will lead you home  
  
Funny how a photograph can take you back in time  
To places and embraces  
That you thought youd left behind  
  
Theyre trying to remind you  
That youre not the only one  
That no one is an island  
When all is said and done  
  
If you feel lost and on your own  
And far from home  
Youre never alone you know  
  
Just think of your friends  
The ones who care  
They all will be waiting there  
With love to share  
And your heart will lead you home  
  
Therell come a day when youre losing your way  
And you wont know where you belong  
  
They say that home is where your heart is  
So follow your heart and know that you cant go wrong  
  
If you feel lost and on your own  
And far from home  
Youre never alone you know  
  
Just think of your friends  
The ones who care  
They all will be waiting there  
With love to share  
And your heart will lead you home  
  
If you feel lost and on your own  
And far from home  
Youre never alone you know  
  
Just think of your friends  
The ones who care  
They all will be waiting there  
With love to share  
And your heart will lead where you belong  
I know your heart will lead you home
