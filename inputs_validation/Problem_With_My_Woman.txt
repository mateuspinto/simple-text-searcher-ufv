Cant take heartache

Chorus  
Another problem with a woman again  
Another problem with a woman again  
Another problem with a woman again  
Another problem with a woman again  
  
Sometimes its hard to express yourself  
To get get things offa your chest my friend  
Tell you one more time  
  
Chorus  
  
Sometimes its hard to express  
You know what I mean Robbie  
To get get things off my chest  
Gonna give you one more chance  
  
Chorus  
  
You know what I mean Robbie  
Say you know what I mean Robbie  
I know you got them too  
A woman again
