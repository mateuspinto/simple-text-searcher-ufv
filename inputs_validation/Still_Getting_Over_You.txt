Since you went away  
Cant face the day  
Just cant face it on my own  
Try to be strong try to carry on  
With a broken heart in an empty home  
  
Lying awake half the night without sleeping  
Hopelessly thinking of you  
Here in my heart I have to admit its true  
Im still getting over you  
  
I begged you not to leave  
I asked you not to run away  
Oh but you wouldnt listen  
I couldnt change your mind  
  
So you left me here behind  
Oh how I miss your touch  
And your tender kissing  
Lying awake half the night without sleeping  
  
Hopelessly thinking of you  
Deep down inside I hate to admit its true  
But Im still getting over you  
  
Lying awake half the night without sleeping  
Hopelessly thinking of you  
Here in my heart I have to admit its true  
Theres nothing I can do  
Im still getting over you
