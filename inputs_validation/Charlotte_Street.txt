I was looking for a rhyme for the new york times  
When I sensed I was not alone  
She said dyou know how to spell audaciously  
I could tell I was in luck  
And so I forced a smile contrary to my style  
And she looked into my eyes  
She said dyou want to go heaven  
Or would you rather not be saved  
Here comes my train  
Im on my way will you not see  
I dont need your sympathy  
I wont read your poetry oh sweetness please  
So she took me back to her basement flat  
Which was down on charlotte street  
Though it was never my intention  
We were not intense not least because  
Well if you must just take then Im a piece of cake  
That is what she said to me  
And so I gave myself to her charity  
Well at least thats how it seemed  
Here comes my train  
Im on my way what got into me  
I dont need your sympathy  
I wont read your poetry oh bittersweets  
I was looking for a rhyme for the new times when I was distracted  
Yes those were precious times together that we wasted  
Now Im working hard for my union card  
I must believe in charlotte street  
Though it was never my intention to stay so long  
So long
