You live in a house of mirrors  
Reflecting your splendid isolation  
You have so much of everything  
Except for true consideration  
The way you dance  
The way you walk  
The way you drive  
The way you talk  
The way you eat  
The way you drink  
The way you act  
The way that you dont think  
  
Its like theres  
Nobody else in the world but you  
Nobody else in the world  
Nobody else in the world but you  
In case you havent noticed  
theres lots of other people here too  
  
Hey now did your momma teach you anything  
Some things still got to be respected  
Is it a sign of the times or is it just your callous heart  
How did you get so disconnected  
  
The way you push  
The way you shove  
The way you hate  
The way you love  
The lies you spin  
The scenes you make  
The grief you give  
The space you take  
Its like theres  
  
Nobody else in the world but you  
Nobody else in the world  
Nobody else in the world but you  
In case you havent noticed  
theres lots of other people here too  
  
And now its time you did a little giving baby  
The world is not your plaything no no no  
  
Solo  
Nobody else in the world but you  
Nobody else in the world  
Nobody else in the world but you  
In case you havent noticed  
theres lots of other people here  
  
Nobody else in the world but you  
Nobody else in the world  
Its like theresnobody else in the world but you  
In case you havent noticed there are lots of other people here too
