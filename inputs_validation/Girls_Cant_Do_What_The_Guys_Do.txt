Ooh ooh  
Guys are gonna want to go out and play sometime  
But girls you must not let it get you down  
Just take this advice I give you  
Just like a mother  
You try to match a guys independence  
You end up in the gutter  
  
Girls you cant do what the guys do no  
And still be a lady  
Girls you cant do what the guys do no  
And still be a lady  
No oh no  
  
And listen girls when you give your heart away  
You can easily be hurt  
And the least little wrong he does  
Always seems like dirt  
So take this advice I give you  
Just like a mother  
You try to match a guys independence  
You end up in the gutter  
  
Girls you cant do what the guys do no  
And still be a lady  
Girls you cant do what the guys do no  
And still be a lady  
No oh no mmm  
  
When you put your faith in one guy  
Sometimes hell make you happy  
Sometimes hell make you cry  
Dont lose your selfrespect  
Tryin to gain revenge  
Cause no matter how you do it  
You lose out in the end  
  
Girls you cant do what the guys do no  
And still be a lady  
Girls you cant do what the guys do no  
And still be a lady  
Girls you cant do what the guys do no  
And still be a lady  
Girls you cant do what the guys do no  
And still be a lady  
Girls you cant do what the guys do no  
And still be a lady  
Girls you cant do what the guys do no
