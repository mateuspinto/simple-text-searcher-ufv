Love is a lie and  
Love is a mess  
Telling the secrets of loneliness  
Our love survive  
How does love survive  
Letters are written  
Words are spoken  
Some hearts are better left unbroken  
How will love survive  
How will love survive  
Little by little step by step  
We were called the dirty pets  
Heart to heart and side by side  
Love will never hide  
  
Locomotion tango on a lonely rainbow  
We will dancin baby  
Dont wait for heroes  
Locomotion tango on a lonely rainbow  
We will dancin baby  
Romancin lady  
  
Locomotion in my heart  
See you dancin in the darkness  
Locomotion let us start  
Let us dancin in the moonlight  
  
Baby youre waiting  
Baby you cry  
See all the fools babe with their lies  
Our love survive  
How does love survive  
What does it take to kill your love  
What does it take to get that stuff  
Our love survive  
How does love survive  
Little by little step by step  
We were called the dirty pets  
Heart to heart side by side  
Love will never hide
