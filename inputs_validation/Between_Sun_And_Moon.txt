There is a lake between sun and moon  
Not too many know about  
In the silence between whisper and shout  
The space between wonder and doubt  
  
This is a fine place  
Shining face to face  
Those bonfire lights in the mirror of sky  
The space between wonder and why  
  
Ahh yes to yes to ahh ahh to yes  
Why the sun  
Why the sun  
  
There is a fine line between love and illusion  
A fine place to penetrate  
The gap between actor and act  
The lens between wishes and fact  
  
This is a fine place  
To hesitate  
Those bonfire lights in the lake of sky  
The time between wonder and why  
  
Ahh yes to yes to ahh ahh to yes  
Why the sun  
Why the sun  
  
Some need to pray to the sun at high noon  
Need to howl at the midwinter moon  
Reborn and baptized in a moment of grace  
We just need a break  
From the headlong race  
  
This is a fine place  
Shining face to face  
Those bonfire lights in the mirrored sky  
The space between wonder and why  
  
Ahh yes to yes to ahh ahh to yes  
Why the sun  
Why the sun
