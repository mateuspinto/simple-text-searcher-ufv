Levelled hammered gone today  
God will have me his own way  
Smokin hun is what I see  
Do you know am I free  
  
Face it kill it  
Beat it to the ground  
Turn it burn it  
Gone without a sound  
Struck down  
  
Locked and tortured by the dream  
Fight the demon to be clean  
Wanton wounds are why I bleed  
Do you know can I see  
  
Chorus  
Face it kill it  
Beat them where they stand  
Turn it burn it  
Fire through your hand  
Release them into nothing  
Give them upside down  
Cut the ties that bind you tight  
Commend them to the ground  
Release them into nothing  
You stand struck down  
  
Hear me screaming up to heaven  
Watch me fall to hell  
Hear me hear us  
We are the gone  
The horde rejected  
See me see us  
We are the ones  
The ones protected  
  
Chorus  
  
Ashesashes dust to dust  
God will have me if he must  
Demon crawl all over me  
Did you know Im not me  
  
Chorus
