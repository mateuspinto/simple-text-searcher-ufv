Since youre the delegate from Kansas  
Will you kindly take the floor  
Now tell us what is Kansas thinkin  
What is Kansas for  
  
Well Kansas is for the farmer  
We stand behind the little man  
We need a fire house in Topeka  
So help us if you can  
  
I see the gentleman from Utah  
Our friendly Beehive State  
How can we help you Utah  
How can we make you great  
  
We got to irrigate our deserts  
We got to get some things to grow  
We got to tell this country about Utah  
Cause nobody seems to know
