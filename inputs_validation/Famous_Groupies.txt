All stand back let the people see  
Take a snap of the famous groupies for me  
  
Behold the famous groupies  
They are alike as two peas  
And where the other goes the other goes  
But though the famous groupies  
Are only paid in rupies  
Nobody knows what the famous groupies know  
And nobody goes where the famous groupies go  
  
There was a bango player  
Who kept an extra layer  
Of dunlopillo mattress in his van  
But when the famous groupies  
Arrived with their twin snoopies  
Nobody saw which way the poor boy ran  
Nobody does it like a famous groupie can  
  
All stand back let the people see  
Take a snap of the famous groupies for me  
  
There was a lead guitarist  
Who lived in Epping forest  
And all he ever wanted was to blow  
When the girls were with him  
He never lost his rhythm  
And nobody knows what the famous groupies know  
Nobody goes where the famous groupies go  
  
There was a classic story  
Of a roadic nicknamed Rory  
Who used to practice voodoo on the side  
When the famous twosome  
Suggested something gruesome  
All that they found was a crater two miles wide  
Which left the music business absolutely horrified  
  
Ladies and gentlemen those magnificent examples of  
Female pulchritude and luminosity direct from their  
Global perambulations to the very boards of this  
Supremely magnificent proscenium arch  ladies and  
Gentlemen
