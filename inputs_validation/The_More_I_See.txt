From where I stand I see  
Pain suffering and misery  
The more I see the more I see  
The less the less I believe  
  
From where I stand I see  
Hate violence and war  
  
The more I see the more I see  
The less the less I believe  
  
The more I see the more I see  
The less the less I believe  
I believe  
  
From where I stand I see  
Pain suffer and misery  
  
The more I see the more I see  
The less the less I believe  
The more I see  
The more I see  
The more I see yeah  
The more I see yeah  
The more I see yeah  
The less the less I believe  
  
Thank You
