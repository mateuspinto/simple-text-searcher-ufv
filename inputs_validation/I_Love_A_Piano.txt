1st verse  
As a child I went wild when a band played  
How I ran to the man when his hand swayed  
Clarinets were my pets and a slide trombone I thought was simply  
Divine  
But today when they play I could hiss them  
Evry bar is a jar to my system  
But theres one musical instrument that I call mine  
  
chorus  
I love a piano I love a piano  
I love to hear somebody play  
Upon a piano a grand piano  
It simply carries me away  
  
I know a fine way to treat a steinway  
I love to run my fingers oer the keys the ivories  
  
And with the pedal I love to meddle  
When padarewski comes this way  
Im so delighted if Im invited  
To hear that long haired genius play  
  
So you can keep your fiddle and your bow  
Give me a piano oh oh  
I love to stop right beside an upright  
Or a high toned baby grand  
  
2nd verse  
When a green tetrazine starts to warble  
I grow cold as an old piece of marble  
I allude to the crude little party singer who dont know when to pause  
At her best I detest the soprano  
But I run to the one at the piano  
I always love the accompniment and thats because
