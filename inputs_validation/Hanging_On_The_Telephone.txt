Im in the phone booth its the one across the hall  
If you dont answer Ill just ring it off the wall  
I know hes there but I just had to call  
  
Dont leave me hanging on the telephone  
Dont leave me hanging on the telephone  
I heard your mother now shes going out the door  
Did she go to work or just go to the store  
  
All those things she said I told you to ignore  
Oh why cant we talk again  
Oh why cant we talk again  
Oh why cant we talk again  
  
Dont leave me hanging on the telephone  
Dont leave me hanging on the telephone  
  
Its good to hear your voice you know its been so long  
If I dont get your call then everything goes wrong  
I want to tell you something youve known all along  
Dont leave me hanging on the telephone  
  
I had to interrupt and stop this conversation  
Your voice across the line gives me a strange sensation  
Id like to talk when I can show you my affection  
  
Oh I cant control myself  
Oh I cant control myself  
Oh I cant control myself  
Dont leave me hanging on the telephone  
  
Hang up and run to me  
Whoah hang up and run to me  
Whoah hang up and run to me  
Whoah hang up and run to me  
Whoah oh oh oh run to me
