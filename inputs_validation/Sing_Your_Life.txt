Sing your life  
Any fool can think of words that rhyme  
Many others do  
Why dont you  
Do you want to  
Oh  
Sing your life  
Walk right up to the microphone  
And name  
All the things you love  
All the things that you loathe  
  
Oh sing your life  
The things that you love  
And the things you loathe  
Oh sing your life  
Oh sing your life  
  
La lala lala sing your life  
La lala lala sing your life  
  
Others sang your life  
But now is a chance to shine  
And have the pleasure of  
Saying what you mean  
Have the pleasure of  
Meaning what you sing  
Oh make no mistake my friend  
All of this will end  
So sing it now sing your life  
All the things you love sing your life  
All the things you loathe  
Oh sing your life  
The things that you love  
And the things you loathe sing your life  
Oh sing oh  
Oh sing oh  
  
La lala lala sing your life  
La lala lala sing your life  
  
Dont leave it all unsaid  
Somewhere in the wasteland of your head oh  
Head oh head oh head oh  
And make no mistake my friend  
Your pointless life will end  
But before you go  
Can you look at the truth   
You have a lovely singing voice  
A lovely singing voice  
And all of those  
Who sing onkey  
They stole the notion  
From you and me  
So sing your life sing your life  
Sing your life sing your life  
Oh sing your oh  
Oh sing your  
Sing your life  
Sing your life  
Sing your life  
Oh sing your oh  
Sing your life  
Sing your life  
Sing your life  
Sing your life
