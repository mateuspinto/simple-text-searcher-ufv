Once upon a time I was on my own  
Once upon a time like youve never known  
Once upon a time I would be impressed  
Once upon a time my life would be obsessed  
Once upon a time once upon a day  
When I was in my prime once along the way  
If you want to know my secret dont come runnin after me  
For I am just a painter passing through in history  
Yesterday is gone yesterdays alright  
Yesterday belongs in my dreams at night  
Yesterday is swell yesterday is great  
Yesterday is strong remembering can wait  
Once upon a time once upon a day  
When I was in my prime once along the way  
If you want to know an answer I cant turn your life around  
For I am just a painter passing through the underground  
I was in my stride always at my game  
Here comes mister cool along the walk of fame  
I was in demand always in control  
The world was in my hands my touch had turn to gold  
Once upon a time I was in a daze  
When I was in my prime once along the way  
If you want to know my secret dont come runnin after me  
For I am just a painter passing through in history  
Now that I am old let me rest a spell  
All that I am told I can never tell  
Never in my life never will it pass  
I am still alone remembering at last  
Once upon a time once upon a day  
When I was in my prime once along the way  
If you want to know an answer I cant turn your life around  
For I am just a painter passing through the underground  
If you want to know my secret dont come runnin after me  
For I am just a painter passing through in history
