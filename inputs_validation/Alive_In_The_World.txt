I want to live in the world not inside my head  
I want to live in the world I want to stand and be counted  
With the hopeful and the willing  
With the open and the strong  
With the voices in the darkness  
Fashioning daylight out of song  
And the millions of lovers  
Alive in the world  
  
I want to live in the world not behind some wall  
I want to live in the world where I will hear if another voice should call  
To the prisoner inside me  
To the captive of my doubt  
Who among his fantasies harbors the dream of breaking out  
And taking his chances  
Alive in the world  
  
Bridge  
To open my eyes and wake up alive in the world  
To open my eyes and fully arrive in the world  
  
With its beauty and its cruelty  
With its heartbreak and its joy  
With it constantly giving birth to life and to forces that destroy  
And the infinite power of change  
Alive in the world  
  
Bridge x2  
To open my eyes and wake up alive in the world  
To open my eyes and fully arrive in the world
