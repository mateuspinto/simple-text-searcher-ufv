Theres a full time reservation  
Made in a bar at the railway station  
And theres a story a kind of fable  
On a card at the corner table  
On it is a message been there some time  
It starts off The coffee tasted so fine  
It says One day this may find you  
These few words may just remind you  
We sat here together just to pass time  
You said how the coffee tasted so fine   
It goes on to say I love you  
If you should find this I must hear from you   
It gives a number but the name has faded away  
All that is left are just the words Maybe someday  
Thats the story and the fable  
Never leave alone from a corner table  
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo  
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
