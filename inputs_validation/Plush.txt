And I feel that times a wasted go  
So where ya going to tomorrow  
And I see that these are lies to come  
Would you even care  
And I feel it  
And I feel it  
Where ya going to tomorrow  
Where ya going with that mask I found  
And I feel and I feel  
When the dogs begin to smell her  
Will she smell alone  
And I feel so much depends on the weather  
So is it raining in your bedroom  
And I see that these are the eyes of disarray  
Would you even care  
And I feel it  
And she feels it  
Where ya going to tomorrow  
Where ya going with that mask I found  
And I feel and I feel  
When the dogs begin to smell her  
Will she smell alone  
When the dogs do find her  
Got time time to wait for tomorrow
