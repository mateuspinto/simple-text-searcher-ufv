this isnt a foo fighters song its by gomez  
Once apon a time  
Not too long ago  
We took a day out in Manchester  
We all fall down  
Theres not enough hours in our day  
Played a bit of football  
Fell into the union  
Barged our way into the toilets  
With the kung foo king  
Theres not enough hours in our day  
  
I remember seeing someone  
Dressed in a suit  
Looking like a lunatic  
And we all fall down  
Theres not enough hours in our trip  
Well academy cartwheels  
Breakin your hands  
We got lovely posters for sale  
And we all fall down  
Theres not enough hours in our day  
  
We like lovin yeah and the wine we share  
We like lovin yeah and the wine we share  
  
Finally made our way  
Back to the train  
Rollin into Sheffield tonight  
We all fall down  
Theres not enough hours in our life  
Try and lose my way  
And wait at the station  
Were whippin Picadilly tonight  
And it all falls down  
Theres not enough hours in our life  
  
We like lovin yeah and the wine we share  
We like lovin yeah and the wine we share
