Through this skin you see  
My heart  
Through this laughter you feel  
My pain  
Even through this mask you see  
My face  
For You are the only one who really knows just who I am  
And you search me  
And you know all the secrets of my heart  
And you search me  
Revealing the mysteries of who You are  
You search me  
Growing up never comes  
Easily  
In Your hands Youre the potter  
Molding me  
Then why do I wear this mask and play this game  
Of hide and seek  
When You are the only one who really knows just who I am  
CHORUS  
My Father my Father  
You are my Father oh and I am Your child  
And you hear my cry even at the midnight  
CHORUS
