I walk around  
I flop uround  
I need something that will be found  
More venom more dynamite more disaster  
I need more than I ever did before  
  
But everything is going up in price  
My life is going all right up til now  
Even so theres something missing  
More truth  
More intelligence  
Ha ha  
More future  
More laugh  
More culture  
Dont forget adrenaline  
More freedom  
  
I need more than an ordinary grind  
And the more I think the more I need  
More tars  
Ill take more money  
More champagne  
I cant forget my brain  
More floors  
More doors  
More mustard  
Pickle and relish  
  
I need more than an ordinary grind  
Everybody ought to love his job  
And live his life and keep his pride  
Imperturbably happy with the one you love  
With an exciting future  
On the fat of the land  
  
I need more than an ordinary grind  
And the more I think the more I need  
My life is going all right up til now  
Even so its not enough for me and  
  
I need more  
I need more  
I need more  
Oo oo oo oo  
Oo oo oo oo  
Than I ever did before  
  
I need to lead a dissipate existence  
And play scratchy records  
And enjoy my decline  
With more divorce records more distance  
more future more culture  
  
More
