My name is Joe Roberts I work for the State  
Im a sergeant out on Perenville barracks No 8  
Ive always done an honest job honest as I could  
Got a brother named Frankie Frankie aint no good  
Ever since we were young kids its been the same come down  
Id get a call on a short way Frankies in trouble downtown  
But if it was any other man Id put him straight away  
But sometimes when its your brother you look the other way  
  
Chorus  
Yeah me and Frankie laughin and drinkin nothin feels better than blood on
blood  
Takin turns dancin with Maria  
  
While the band played The Night Of The Johnstown Flood  
I catch him when hes strayin like any brother should  
Man turns his back on his family he aint no good  
Well Frankie went into the army back in 1965  
I got a farm deferment settled down took Maria for my wife  
But them wheat prices kept on droppin till it was like wes gettin robbed  
Frankie came home in 68 and me I took this job  
  
Chorus  
  
While the band played The Night Of The Johnstown Flood  
I catch him when hes strayin teach him how to walk that line  
Man turns his back on his family aint no friend of mine  
The night was like any other I got a call bout the quarter of nine  
There was trouble at a roadhouse out on the Michigan line  
There was a kid on the floor lookin bad bleedin hard from his head  
There was a girl cryin at a table it was Frankie she said  
I ran out and I jumped in my car then I hit the lights  
I must have done about a hundred and ten to Michigan County that night  
It was down by the crossroads out bout willow bank  
Seen the Buick with Ohio plates behind the wheel was Frank  
Well I chased him through them county roads  
Till the sign said Canadian border five miles from here  
Pulled over to the south out the highway watched his taillights disappeared  
  
Chorus  
  
While the band played The Night Of The Johnstown Flood  
I catch him when hes strayin like any brother should  
Man turns his back on his family aint no good
