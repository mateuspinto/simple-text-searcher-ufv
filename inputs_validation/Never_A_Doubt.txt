There was never a doubt never a doubt in my mind  
We werent meant to be lonely  
Never a doubt I knew that Id find you some day  
There was never a doubt after all of those nights alone  
All those desperate mornings  
Never a doubt there was never a doubt in my mind  
  
I suppose there have been times when you felt like a room filled with darkness  
Not a window around  
There must have been moments you felt you were truly alone  
Then again each of us knows in a night of unbearable sadness  
Still a light can be found  
In each morning the promise that someday your true love will come  
  
I suppose there are some people who never believe in the magic  
Oh the magic of love  
They think nothing is precious and life is just pleasure and pain  
Then again each of us knows when a heart has been broken its tragic  
Oh the magic of love  
Even that which is broken with love can be mended again  
  
All the things that you fear at the most they mean nothing  
All the sorrow and sadness can just disappear  
  
There was never a doubt never a doubt in my mind  
We werent meant to be lonely  
Never a doubt I knew that Id find you some day  
There was never a doubt after all of those nights alone  
All those desperate mornings  
Never a doubt there was never a doubt in my mind  
There was never a doubt in my mind  
Never a doubt in my mind
