Ground Control to Major Tom  
Ground Control to Major Tom  
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on  
Ground Control to Major Tom  
Commencing countdown engines on  
Check ignition and may Gods love be with you  
  
Ten Nine Eight Seven Six Five  
Four Three Two One Liftoff  
  
This is Ground Control to Major Tom  
Youve really made the grade  
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear  
Now its time to leave the capsule if you dare  
  
This is Major Tom to Ground Control  
Im stepping through the door  
And Im floating in a most peculiar way  
And the stars look very different today  
  
For here  
Am I sitting in a tin can  
Far above the world  
Planet Earth is blue  
And theres nothing I can do  
  
Though Im past one hundred thousand miles  
Im feeling very still  
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go  
Tell my wife I love her very much she knows  
  
Ground Control to Major Tom  
Your circuits dead theres something wrong  
Can you hear me Major Tom  
Can you hear me Major Tom  
Can you hear me Major Tom  
Can you  
  
Here am I floating round my tin can  
Far above the Moon  
Planet Earth is blue  
And theres nothing I can do
