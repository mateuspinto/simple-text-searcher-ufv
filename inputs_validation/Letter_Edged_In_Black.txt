I was standing by the window yesterday morning  
Without a thought of worry or of care  
When I saw the postman coming up the pathway  
With such a happy look and jolly air  
  
Chorus  
As I heard the postman whistling yester morning  
Coming down the pathway with his pack  
Oh he little knew the sorrow that he brought me  
When he handed me that letter edged in black  
  
Oh he rang the bell and whistled while he waited  
And then he said Good morning to you Jack  
But he little knew the sorrow that he brought me  
When he handed me that letter edged in black  
  
With trembling hand I took the letter from him  
I broke the seal and this is what it said  
Come home my boy your dear old father wants you  
Come home my boy your dear old mothers dead  
  
The last words that your mother ever uttered  
Tell my boy I want him to come back  
My eyes are blurred my poor old heart is breaking  
For Im writing you this letter edged in black  
  
I bow my head in sorrow and in silence  
The sunshine of my life it all has fled  
Since the postman brought that letter yester morning  
SayingCome home my boy your dear old mothers dead  
  
Those angry words I wish Id never spoken  
You know I never meant them dont you Jack  
May the angels bear me witness I am asking  
Your forgiveness in this letter edged in black
