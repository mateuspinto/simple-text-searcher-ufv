From the drip drip drip of the teardrops  
To the chink chink chink of the cash  
To the end end end of the friendships  
To the wack wack wack of the bash  
Corruption corruption corruption  
Rules my soul  
Corruption corruption corruption  
Rules my soul  
  
From the tick tick tick of your times up  
To the yes yes yes of Ill sell  
From the fact fact fact of the soulless  
To the pact pact pact with hell  
Corruption corruption corruption  
Rules my soul  
Corruption corruption corruption  
Chills my bones  
Corruption corruption corruption  
Rules my soul  
Corruption corruption corruption  
Chills my bones  
  
From the scream scream scream of the babies  
To the retch retch retch of the youth  
From the lie lie lie of the righteous  
To the lost lost lost way I feel  
Corruption corruption corruption  
Rules my bones  
Corruption corruption corruption  
Chills my bones  
Corruption corruption corruption  
Rules my soul  
Corruption corruption corruption  
Rules my soul  
Corruption  
Corruption  
  
Order in the court  
Decision to abort  
The monkey wants to speak  
So speak monkey speak  
Speak monkey speak  
Speak monkey speak  
Speak monkey speak  
  
Everything leads to corruption  
Everything leads to corruption  
Corruption
