In a time of quietness I reflect on childhood memories  
Caught wisping through my mind  
Falling leaves create the stage  
Words spoken were not cherished  
  
On the last day of our friendship  
And those words were possibly the last  
What were your thoughts  
  
As a dreaming child I awaken to a nightmare  
After a gentle nudge I find out youre gone  
  
The machines that kept you alive were careless  
Did you ask Him to forgive you  
Before before you passed on you slipped  
You slipped you passed on  
The machines that kept you alive were careless  
Did you ask Him to forgive you  
Before you passed on  
  
You slipped on away into the ground  
You broke the vanity  
You brought the silence
