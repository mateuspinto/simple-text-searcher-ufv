Passing through air  
You mix the stars with your arms  
Walking through there  
The doom of eternity balms  
Skies of gray are not today  
  
Chorus  
Oh Dont you throw my love away  
I need your loving I need your loving  
Oh Dont you pour down rain today  
I need your love I need your care  
So much so much so much  
  
Laughing through smiles  
You lick my love with the years  
Walking for miles  
You cool my brow with your tears  
Skies of gray are not today  
  
Oh Dont you throw my love away  
I need your loving I need your loving  
Oh Dont you pour down rain today  
I need your love I need your care  
So much so much so much  
  
Chorus x2
