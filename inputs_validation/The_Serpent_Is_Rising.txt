In the abyss of space  
From the center of time  
A superman race  
Moves the Serpent to climb  
  
The journey has lasted  
Seven ages or more  
Life after life  
Must pass through the door  
  
The secret revealed  
When you leave your cave  
Is a glory of thunder  
And life from the grave  
  
The Serpent is rising  
Uncoiling in your spine  
Bringing you light  
From the depths of your mind  
  
The people have massed  
In the center of town  
We drink from a glass  
And the world turns around  
  
The Serpent is rising  
Uncoiling in your spine  
Bringing you light  
From the depths of your mind  
  
The Serpent is rising  
Uncoiling in your spine  
Bringing you light  
From the depths of your mind  
  
The Serpent is rising  
Uncoiling in your spine  
Bringing you light  
From the depths of your mind
