Lyrics by Alan Parsons  
  
You drink the wine  
You play the fool  
You cross the line  
You lose your cool  
But no one cares  
Still no one cares  
  
You raise the bar  
Lost in a trance  
One bridge too far  
No second chance  
But no one cares  
Still no one cares  
  
We play the game  
We hold our own  
We fight to win  
We stand alone  
  
You had a dream  
You cast the dice  
Your shady scheme  
You paid the price  
But no one cares  
Still no one cares  
  
We play the game  
With hearts of stone  
You lose again  
Youre on your own  
  
A turning tide  
A streak of light  
Arms open wide  
The ends in sight  
And someone cares  
Yes someone cares  
  
We play the game  
We hold our own  
We fight to win  
We stand alone
