I will not drown in shallow water  
Not with your love within my reach  
I did not come this far to falter  
And will not rest until Im free  
You are the sun you are the flower  
You are the wind across the sea  
And I will kneel here at your altar  
And pray youll take my soul to keep  
Oh precious one you are the mountain  
You are the earth beneath my feet  
In you were one now and forever  
In you I find the love in me  
Through your love my eyes are open  
Through your love Ill learn to see  
And in your name my bread is broken  
By your grace Ill rest in peace  
I will not drown in shallow water  
Not with your love within my reach  
I did not come this far to falter  
And will not rest until Im free  
Through your love my eyes are open  
Through your love Ill learn to see  
And in your name my bread is broken  
By your grace Ill rest in peace  
I will not drown in shallow water  
Not with your love within my reach  
I did not come this far to falter  
And will not rest until Im free  
I will not rest until Im free  
Until Im free
