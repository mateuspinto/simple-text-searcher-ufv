Somebody was spreading rumors  
bout better days a comin  
Why was I hummin  
As if I knew  
One and the same  
But I just whispered your name  
  
Somebody was sayin something  
bout there being an end to tyranny  
But when they asked me  
What would I do  
If that day came  
I only whispered your name  
  
Everyone got their own opinion  
And protects their own dominion  
No doubt for them its true  
But I tell them what I really believe  
My only worry is protecting you  
  
No one should ever be lonely  
Wed all find somebody to care  
Ask me if I dare  
To answer who  
Could carry that flame  
Id just whisper your name
