I was riding  
Riding on my bike  
Me with my friend  
Were so alike  
  
Am I all alone  
She said all we  
Have is this  
We just had to stop  
And share a kiss  
  
Am I all alone  
One hot minute  
And Im in it come and get it 3 times  
If I chase it  
I might waste it  
Come and get it  
  
Am I all alone  
Sitting in the fire  
Get along and have some fun  
Floating to be higher  
Maybe Im your special one  
Silent testifier  
Breathe the moon  
And eat the sun  
Sitting in the fire  
  
A tiny wink is all  
All we have  
No its not much more  
But dont get mad  
  
Am I all alone  
Close your eyes  
And click your heels  
Can you believe  
How good it feels  
  
Am I all alone  
One hot minute  
And Im in it come and get it 3 times  
If I chase it I might waste it  
Come and get it  
  
Am I all alone  
Three lbs of love  
Inside my skull  
A million more lives  
Its never dull  
Just a few times spun  
Spun around the sun  
A couple more or less  
And then were done
