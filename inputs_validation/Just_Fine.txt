Hey uh um hey oh girl oh girl  
  
We did everything we could do  
To try to make it work we did we did  
Baby you look soo confused  
Cause it feels like there was no way we could lose no way no way  
Baby I just dont reply  
Cause I cant find the things you need in me I cant I cant girl  
Baby they know just know what to say  
Their trying to break us away from one another  
But maybe their right for a change  
  
I think God will give you  
Someone much better  
Than me trust me your life will be ok it will be alright  
Youll be just fine just fine just fine  
  
I know that baby we would disagree constantly  
On the basic things we did we did  
You thought that there was someone else all along no way no way  
Baby I want to decide to stay right by your side  
Baby they know just what to say  
They wanna keep us away from one another  
But Maybe theyre right for a change  
  
I think God will give you  
Someone much better  
Than me trust me your eyes will be  
Ok ok alright alright just fine just fine

Just may be the kinda man you need  
Baby you deserve it and I know that  
I know another love has come your way just listen to me when I say  
You earned it you earned it  
  
I think God will give you  
Someone much better  
Than me trust me your eyes will be  
Ok it will alright it will be just fine just fine
