I wanna bring love back to the radio  
Can I bring love songs back to the radio  
I wanna be blind tonight while Im loving you  
I wanna have to find my way  
And I dont wanna have a clue  
Just let the universe surprise me  
When I walk into your room babe  
I got a whole lot of kissing and a whole lot of touching  
And a whole lot of loving waiting on you babe  
Got a whole lot of feeling and a whole lot of thrilling  
And a whole lot of healing wanna please you  
So lets turn off all the lights because  
  
Chorus  
Babe tonight I wanna be lost in your love  
Babe tonight I wanna get lost in your love  
Girl tonight  
Babe tonight I wanna get lost in your love  
Babe tonight I wanna get lost in your love  
I wanna get lost babe  
I wanna get lost babe  
I wanna get lost babe  
I wanna get lost babe  
  
I wanna make love in  
I love feeling on you yeah babe  
And I dont wanna have to care  
You just do what you wanna do  
To me babe  
I wanna drift far out in your girl  
  
And get trapped in your wilderness  
I got a whole lot of kissing and a whole lot of touching  
And a whole lot of loving waiting on you yes babe  
Got a whole lot of feeling and a whole lot of thrilling  
And a whole lot of healing wanna please you  
  
Chorus  
  
We dont need no explanation  
Cause this love will make our confirmation  
So let it do let it do  
Girl let us lose ourselves in this magic  
Now babe tonight  
  
Chorus
