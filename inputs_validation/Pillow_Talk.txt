Pillow talk pillow talk  
Another night of hearin myself talk talk talk talk  
Wonder how it would be to have someone to pillow talk with me  
I wonder how  
I wonder who  
Pillow talk pillow talk  
Another night of bein alone with pillow talk  
When its all said and done two heads together can be better than one  
Thats what they say  
They always say  
All I do is talk to my pillow  
Talk to my pillow talk to my pillow  
All I do is talk to my pillow  
Talk about the boy Im gonna marry someday  
Somehow some way sometime  
Pillow talk pillow talk  
Another night of gettin my fill of pillow talk  
You and I both agree there must be a boy must be a pillow  
Must be a pillowtalkin boy for me  
I hope Im right  
Id better be right  
Oh there must be a pillowtalkin boy for me  
We hope shes right shed better be right there must be a boy  
There must be a boy  
There must be a boy  
There must be a boy  
There MUST be a boy  
There MUST
