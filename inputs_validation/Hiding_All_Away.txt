You went looking for nur dear  
Down by the sea  
You found some Iittle silver fish  
But you didnt find me  
I was hiding dear hiding all way  
I was hiding dear hiding all way  
  
You went to the museum  
You climbed a spiral stair  
You searched for me all among  
The knowledgeable air  
I was hidden babe hiding all away  
I was hidden dear hiding all away  
  
You entered the cathedral  
When you heard the solemn knell  
I was not sitting with the gargoyles  
I was not swinging from the hell  
I was hiding dear I was hiding all away  
I was hiding dear I was hiding all away  
  
You asked an electrician  
If hed seen me round his place  
He touched you with his fingers  
Sent sparks zapping out your face  
I was hidden dear hiding all away  
I was not there dear hiding all away  
  
You went and asked your doctor  
To get some advice  
He shot you full of Pethidine  
And then he billed you twice  
  
But I was hiding dear hiding all away  
But I was hiding dear hiding all away  
  
You approached a high court judge  
You thought hed be on the level  
He wrapped a rag around your face  
And beat you with his gavel  
I was hiding habe hiding all away  
I was hidden dem hiding all away  
  
You asked at the local constabulary  
They said hes up to his same old tricks  
They leered at you with their baby blues  
And rubbed jelly on their sticks  
I had to get out of there babe hiding all away  
I had to get out of there dear hiding all away  
  
You searched through all my poets  
From Sappho through to Auden  
I saw the book fall from your hands  
As you slowly died of boredom  
I had been there dear  
But I was not there anymore  
I had been there now Im hiding all way  
  
You walked into the ball of fame  
And approached my imitators  
Some were stuffing their faces with caviar  
Some were eating cold potatoes  
I was hiding dear hiding all away  
I was hiding dear hiding all away  
  
You asked a famous cook if hed seen me  
He opened his oven wide  
He basted you with butter babe  
And made you crawl inside  
I was not in there dear hiding all away  
I was not in there dear hiding all away  
  
You asked the butcher  
Who lifted up his cleaver  
Stuck his fist up your dress  
Said he mustve been mad to leave you  
But I had to get away dear hiding all away  
I had to get away dear I was hidden all away  
  
Some of us we hide away  
Some of us we dont  
Some will live to love another day  
And some of us wont  
But we all know there is a law  
And that law it is love  
And we all know theres a war coming  
Coming from above  
  
There is a war coming  
There is a war coming
