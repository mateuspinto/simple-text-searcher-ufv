Air Air  
Hit me in the face  
I run faster  
Faster faster faster  
Faster into the air  
I say to myself  
What is happening to my skin  
Where is that protection that I needed  
Air can hurt you too  
Air can hurt you too  
Some people say not to worry about the air  
Some people never had experience with  
  
Air Air  
It can break your heart  
So remember when the weather gets rough  
Youll say to yourself  
What is happening to my skin  
Where is that protection that I needed  
Air can hurt you too  
Air can hurt you too  
Some people say not to worry about the air  
Some people dont know shit about the  
Air
