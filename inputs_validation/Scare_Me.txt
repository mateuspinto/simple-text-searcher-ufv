Im not afraid of lonely  
Ive gotten good at being that  
Aint seen nothin that could hold me  
Say goodbye and dont look back  
  
Running always ready  
Feel as strong and steady  
But you scare me  
  
Took a long walk after midnight  
Trying to make sense of it all  
Tried to catch a glimpse of my old life  
But your face was all I saw  
  
Blue eyes staring through me  
Baby what are you doing to me  
You never felt this before its all brand new to me never known anyone
scare me  
You Im doing what I said I would never do too late to stop it now scare me  
  
Knowing theres no turning back  
Knowing I dont want to  
  
Baby you never felt this before its all brand new to me never known
anyone scare me  
You Im doing what I said I would never do too late to stop it now scare me  
Scare me  
Scare me  
Baby you scare me  
Scare me
