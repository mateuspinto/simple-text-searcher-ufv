Across the bridge where angels dwell  
Across the bridge where angels  
Across the bridge where angels dwell  
Children play  
  
Beyond the place where time is still  
Beyond the place where time is  
Beyond the place where time is still  
Night is day  
  
Close your eyes in fields of wonder  
Close your eyes and dream  
Close your eyes in fields of wonder  
Close your eyes and dream  
  
Along the path where heaven lies  
Along the path where heaven  
Along the path where heaven lies  
All is clear  
  
Ahead where home awaits the heart  
Ahead where home is waiting  
Ahead where home awaits the heart  
Peace is near  
  
Close your eyes in fields of wonder  
Close your eyes and dream  
Close your eyes in fields of wonder  
Close your eyes and dream  
  
Across the bridge where angels dwell  
Across the bridge where angels  
Across the bridge where angels dwell  
Children play
