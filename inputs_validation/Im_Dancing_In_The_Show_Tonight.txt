Are my lemons tied Is my hair in place  
Have I got a cute expression on my face  
Are my shoes all shined  
I try to keep in line when Im dancing in the show tonight  
  
Does my shuffle step really look so good  
Am I doing it the way you think I should  
Would it be amiss if I blew a kiss  
When Im dancing in the show tonight  
  
Showtime now is getting nearer and Im getting scared  
Wish I could see in the mirror if Im all prepared  
  
First you take a step then you point your toe  
Hope I know it like I did a week ago  
Am I standing straight  
I can hardly wait till Im dancing in the show tonight
