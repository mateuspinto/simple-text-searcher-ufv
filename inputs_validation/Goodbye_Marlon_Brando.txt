Say goodbye to loneliness say goodbye to Marlon Brando  
Say goodbye to latitudes and the confusion that surrounds you  
Say goodbye to misery say goodbye to the morning news  
Say goodbye to prime time and the fools that choose to view  
Say goodbye to Wendy say goodbye to Rhonda  
Say goodbye to the Beach Boys from the Palisades to Kona  
  
Say goodbye to Glasnost say goodbye to Malathion  
Say goodbye to the clowns in congress and the belt around Orion  
Say goodbye to the tabloids say goodbye to diet soda  
Say goodbye to new age music from the Capa to the Coda  
Say goodbye to gridlock goodbye to Dollys chest  
Goodbye to the ozone layer if theres any of it left  
  
Dont it make you want to crawl back to the womb  
Find a sanitarium rent yourself a room  
This overload is edging me further out to sea  
I need to put some distance between overkill and me me  
  
Say goodbye to Jackie Collins say goodbye to illiterate fools  
Goodbye to evangelists and geeks with power tools  
Goodbye to statuettes say goodbye to lists  
Say goodbye to articles on who the senator kissed  
Say goodbye to hair styles goodbye to heavens gate  
Goodbye to Rocky Five Six Seven and Eight
