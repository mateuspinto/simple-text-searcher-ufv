I dug up a diamond  
Rare and fine  
I dug up a diamond  
In a deep dark mine  
If only I could cling to  
My beautiful find  
I dug up a diamond  
In a deep dark mine  
  
My gem is special  
Beyond all worth  
As strong as any metal  
Or stone in the earth  
Sharp as any razor  
Or blade you can buy  
Bright as any laser  
Or any star in the sky  
  
Maybe once in a lifetime  
Youll hold one in your hand  
Once in a lifetime  
In this land  
Where the journey ends  
In a worthless claim  
Time and again  
In the mining game  
  
I dug up a diamond  
Rare and fine  
I dug up a diamond  
In a deep dark mine  
Down in the darkness  
In the dirt and the grime  
I dug up a diamond  
In a deep dark mine
