A shoe shine boy gave me a nickel  
With a smile on his face  
The school kids would give me some gin  
If I would let them in  
They were shaking all over  
  
Ran into a friend with a lonely lady on his arm  
Woke up in my garage I was holding my own  
Cant remember where Id been  
I was aching all over  
From rolling on the stone  
I was aching all over from rolling on the hard stone  
  
Ooh what a night you can have when youre a big boy  
Ooh what a night you can have when youre a real big boy  
Ooh what a night you can have when youre a big boy  
Ooh what a night you can have when youre a real big boy  
  
Kissin cousins just aint my style  
Not like some knight in shining armor  
Touring with the sideshow  
That was my blow  
But we hung on for the fun  
Lots of fun for everyone  
  
Ooh what a night you can have when youre a big boy  
Ooh what a night you can have when youre a real big boy  
Ooh what a night you can have when youre a big boy  
Ooh what a night you can have when youre a real big boy  
  
Till the danger man with his danger plan  
He took me aside  
And then he took me apart  
I was a young man with love in my heart  
Oh how he made me pay  
It was the hard way  
It was the hard way  
  
Ooh what a night you can have when youre a big boy  
Ooh what a night you can have when youre a real big boy  
Ooh what a night you can have when youre a big boy  
Ooh what a night
