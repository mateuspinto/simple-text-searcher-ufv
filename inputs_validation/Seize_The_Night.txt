Come with me and bless the night  
Let the darkness be your salvation  
Curse the day escape the light  
Break the chain of imagination  
  
Come with me and seize the night  
Nows the time for some inspiration  
Leave the day and loose the light  
No taboos only new sensations  
  
In the shadows of the city  
A heros waiting for the call  
And all the angels are waking up  
And all the devils start to fall  
  
In the shadows of the city  
Theyre dying for a thrill  
Theyre going out over the edge  
Theyre moving in for the kill  
  
You gotta curse the day its nothing but a merciless light  
So open up your arms and then you get down on your knees  
You suck in all the darkness and youre ready now to seize  
Seize the night  
Seize the night  
  
Dies irae Kyrie Libera me Domine  
Dies irae Kyrie Requiem da Domine  
Dies irae Kyrie Libera me Domine  
Dies irae Kyrie Requiem da Domine  
  
Dies irae Kyrie Sanctus Sanctus exultate  
  
Bless the night before it has the chance to pass  
Seize the night you do what it takes to make it last  
Bless the night before it has the chance to pass  
Seize the night you do what it takes to make it last  
  
Bless the night before it has the chance to pass  
Seize the night you do what it takes to make it last  
  
Let your dreams out of their cages  
Every passion and desire  
Let your visions be outrageous  
Set your fantasies on fire  
  
Everything will be permitted  
Therell be nothing left to fear  
I got the magic in your body  
Your inhibitions disappear  
  
You gotta curse the day its nothing but a merciless light  
So open up your arms and then you get down on your knees  
You suck in all the darkness and youre ready now to seize  
Seize the night  
Seize the night  
  
Dies irae Kyrie Libera me Domine  
Dies irae Kyrie Requiem da Domine  
Dies irae Kyrie Libera me Domine  
Dies irae Kyrie Requiem da Domine  
  
Bless the night before it has the chance to pass  
Seize the night you do what it takes to make it last  
Bless the night memories collide to change the past  
Seize the night you do what it takes to make it last  
  
Carpe Noctem  
Carpe Noctem  
  
Bless the night before it has the chance to pass  
Seize the night you do what it takes to make it last  
  
Dies irae Kyrie Requiem da Domine  
Dies irae Kyrie Sanctus Sanctus exultate  
  
Come with me and bless the night  
Let the darkness be your salvation  
Curse the day escape the light  
Break the chain of imagination  
  
Come with me and seize the night  
Nows the time for some inspiration  
Leave the day and loose the light  
No taboos only new sensations
