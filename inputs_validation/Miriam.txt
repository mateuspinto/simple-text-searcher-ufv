Curtains of back were inside the room  
Shutting out the light the light that always hurt his eyes  
There was nothing bright in this entire mansion no no  
Except for the candlelight the light and the fire that burned real slow  
  
Oh Miriam why did you have to go and die  
  
Curtains of black were inside the room  
Abigail was not alone there was someone else in here too  
Come closer dear said the shadow in the wheelchair  
Stand by the fireplace so I can better see your face  
  
Oh Miriam why did you have to go and die  
  
Solo Andy  
  
The shadow could not believe the likeness in her face  
It looked as if his Miriam had come back from the grave  
I am Count de La Fey and you are  
Abigail she whispered and shivered to the bone  
Can I he said Can I can I call you Miriam  
  
Miriam or Abigail is fine  
You can even call me Lucy for it is just a name  
  
He struggled out of the wheelchair  
Since his fall many years ago  
Now he could only walk by a cane what a shame  
  
Solo Andy  
  
Dont move Stay where you are and then he was right behind her  
Touching her long black hair he was breathing much harder now  
Then he grabbed her head  
  
In the pain she screamed as he  
Yanked out a lock of that beautiful hair oh dear oh dear oh dear  
  
He quickly struggled across the floor to a smaller cabinet  
Behind glass door it said To My beloved Dear  
It was then he started to compare and she saw the other HAIR  
In his twisted mind she was back but why  
I must retire my dear in order to prepare  
You should do the same tomorrow an heir
