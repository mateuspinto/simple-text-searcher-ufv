Down the way where the nights are gay  
And the sun shines brightly on the mountaintop  
I took a trip on a sailing ship  
And when I reached Jamaica I made a stop  
But Im sad to say Im on my way  
Wont be back for many a day  
My heart is down my head is turning around  
I miss all my friends in Kingston town  
  
Down at the market you can hear  
All the ladies cry out while on their heads they bear  
Akie rice salt fish are nice  
And the sun is fine any time of the year  
  
CHORUS  
But Im sad to say Im on my way  
Wont be back for many a day  
My heart is down my head is turning around  
I miss all my friends in Kingston town  
  
Sounds of laughter everywhere  
And the children sway to and fro  
I must declare that my heart is there  
Though Ive been from Maine to Mexico  
  
CHORUS twice  
But Im sad to say Im on my way  
Wont be back for many a day  
My heart is down my head is turning around  
I miss all my friends in Kingston town
