I love to see the cottonwood blossom  
In the early spring  
I love to see the message of love  
That the bluebird brings  
  
But when I see you walkin with him  
Down along the strand  
I wish I were blind  
When I see you with your man  
  
I love to see your hair shining  
In the long summers light  
I love to watch the stars fill the sky  
On a summer night  
  
The music plays you take his hand  
I watch how you touch him as you start to dance  
And I wish I were blind  
When I see you with your man  
  
We struggle here but all our loves in vain  
And these eyes that once filled me with your beauty  
Now fill me with pain  
And the light that once entered here  
Is banished from me  
And this darkness is all baby that my heart sees  
  
And though the world is filled  
With the grace and beauty of Gods hand  
Oh I wish I were blind  
When I see you with your man
