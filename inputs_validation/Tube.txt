An asteroid crashed and nothing burned  
It made me wonder  
Do tigers sleep in lily patches  
Do rhinos run from thunder  
I got an ache in my left ear  
I felt the truth but I still could hear  
Made me think I would not be burned  
But rather give myself to science  
I felt that I could help  
To science I felt that I can help  
  
Paranoid the doctor ran  
Shouting his graphic translation  
All out of order  
Gang wars and ails of riches  
Spewing forth their color  
He purposely waited till I was done  
To knock on the lavatory door  
Accusing me of ruining the fun  
He knocked on it some more  
The fun He knocked on it some more  
  
And alloy suitors were all inside  
An apple or a grape  
To put forth a cloud of Mercury  
In front of a mighty car  
On a freeway in Los Angeles  
Once the spraying has been done  
Cause theres more pain from necessity  
Youre a portrait of your past  
Theres a mummy in the cabinet  
Are there no more arrows left  
  
Whats that rubber bottle doing here  
Hows that napkin for a proof  
Ten cents to a dollar now  
For a shelf of pregnant hens  
  
Robert Palmer is employed  
Again again again  
So stupendous living in this tube
