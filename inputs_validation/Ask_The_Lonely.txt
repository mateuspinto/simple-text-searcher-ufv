Just ask the lonely  
  
When you feel that need  
To make it all alone  
Remember no one is thinking of  
Going alone  
  
Just ask the lonely  
They know the hurt and pain  
Of losing a love you can never regain  
  
Just ask the lonely  
Just ask the lonely  
  
The young and foolish laugh at love Woo hoo  
So they run away Woo hoo hoo hoo  
Confident and sure that fate Woo hoo  
Will bring another love their way  
  
Ah But ask the lonely  
Ah How vainly a heart can yearn  
Ah For losing a love that will never return  
  
Just ask the lonely  
Just ask the lonely  
Theyll tell you  
  
Ooh Woo hoo hoo hoo ooh  
  
Ah Theyll tell you a story of sadness  
Ah A story too hard to believe  
Ah theyll tell you the loneliest one is me  
  
Just ask the lonely  
Just ask the lonely  
  
Ask me  
Im the loneliest one youll see  
  
Just ask the lonely
