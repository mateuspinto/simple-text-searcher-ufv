Lets swim to the moon uh huh  
Lets climb through the tide  
Penetrate the evenin that the  
City sleeps to hide  
Lets swim out tonight love  
Its our turn to try  
Parked beside the ocean  
On our moonlight drive  
Lets swim to the moon uh huh  
Lets climb through the tide  
Surrender to the waiting worlds  
That lap against our side  
Nothin left open  
And no time to decide  
Weve stepped into a river  
On our moonlight drive  
Lets swim to the moon  
Lets climb through the tide  
You reach your hand to hold me  
But I cant be your guide  
Easy I love you  
As I watch you glide  
Falling through wet forests  
On our moonlight drive baby  
Moonlight drive  
Come on baby gonna take a little ride  
Down down by the ocean side  
Gonna get real close  
Get real tight  
Baby gonna drown tonight  
Goin down down down
