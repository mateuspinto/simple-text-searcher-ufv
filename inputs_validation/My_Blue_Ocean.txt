I once heard Captain Dan tell me a story  
About this lovely girl whos name was Jane  
She was vast and deep and filled with glory  
Aaaahhhh  
Bottom served as home for hull and anchor  
Shes always fit to quarrel with the wind  
The great Titanic yes its she that sank her  
Aaaahhhh  
Then she heard me  
Say that oath that  
Made everything clear  
I love you  
My ocean blue  
I like the way your sea sees me  
My darling Jane  
She speaks to me at times through falling rain  
Now twas time to manifest her vigor  
Was she fit to quarrel with the wind  
The air was strong but Jane she was much bigger  
Aaaaahhhh  
Then she heard me  
Say that oath that  
Made everything clear  
I love you  
My ocean blue  
I like the way your sea sees me  
My darling Jane  
Oh me my darling Jane  
Oh me and my darling Jane  
She speaks to me at times through falling rain  
Speaks to me at times through falling rain
