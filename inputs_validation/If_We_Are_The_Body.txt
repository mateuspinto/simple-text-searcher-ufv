Its crowded in worship today  
As she slips in trying to fade into the faces  
The girls teasing laughter is carying farther than they know  
Farther than they know  
  
But if we are the body  
Why arent His arms reaching  
Why arent His hands healing  
Why arent His words teaching  
  
And if we are the body  
Why arent His feet going  
Why is His love not showing them there is a way  
There is a way  
  
A traveler is far away from home  
He sheds his coat and quietly sinks into the back row  
The weight of their judgemental glances tells him that his chances  
Are better out on the road  
  
But if we are the body  
Why arent His arms reaching  
Why arent His hands healing  
Why arent His words teaching  
  
And if we are the body  
Why arent His feet going  
Why is His love not showing them there is a way  
  
Jesus paid much to high a price for us to pick and choose who should come  
And we are the body of Christ  
  
If we are the body  
Why arent His arms reaching  
Why arent His hands healing  
Why arent His words teaching  
  
And if we are the body  
Why arent His feet going  
Why is His love not showing them there is a way  
  
If we are the body  
Why arent His arms reaching  
Why arent His hands healing  
Why arent His word teaching  
  
And if we are the body  
Why arent His feet going  
Why is His love not showing them there is a way  
  
Jesus is the way
