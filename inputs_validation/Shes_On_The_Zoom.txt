Well she got up every morning and she waited in the cold  
Got on the stinking yellow school bus and did what she was told  
And she stared out the window all the way down to high school  
She went to home economics just like all the other girls  
  
Making chicken a la king and peanut butter swirls  
But she knew in her heart there had to be something better somewhere  
Well the boys in the school they were just a bunch of fools  
And they acted like a bunch of bad bumpkins  
  
But she went out with this guy cause she knew a girls gotta do something  
He showed her pictures of his car pictures of his car  
Pictures of his room pictures of his room  
Ohhhh shes on the zoom shes on the zoom  
  
She wasnt meant to stick around here and be some quarterbacks wife  
She wasnt meant to stick around here be barefoot and pregnant the rest  
of her life  
Well she got up every morning and she waited in the cold  
  
Got on the stinking yellow cab put the money through the hole  
And she stared out the window all the way down Fifth Avenue  
She went on all the cattle calls just like all the other girls  
And she waited by the phone in her rollers and her curls  
  
But she knew in her heart there had to be something better  
Well she ran into this guy who was down at 54  
Had a lot of gold and chains and he got her in the door  
And he knew so many people and he made her lots of pretty promises  
  
He showed her pictures of his car pictures of his car  
Pictures of his room pictures of his room  
Ohhhh shes on the zoom shes on the zoom  
He showed her pictures of his car pictures of his car  
  
Pictures of his room pictures of his room  
Ohhhh shes on the zoom shes on the zoom  
Ohhhh shes on the zoom shes on the zoom
