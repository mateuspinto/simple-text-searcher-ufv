Im seeing you for the last time  
Youve been untrue for the last time  
I know that youve been usin me for a past time  
Its the last time the first time for me  
  
I found you and that love for the first time  
When I caught you cheatin me it was my worst time  
  
Im seein you for the last time  
Ive been a fool for the last time  
You only strung along with me for a past time  
Its the last time the first time for me  
  
I found you and that love for the first time  
When I caught you cheatin me it was my worst time  
  
Im seein you for the last time  
Ive been a fool for the last time  
You only strung along with me for a past time  
Its the last time the first time  
The first time its the last time
