I cant believe the way Your love has got a hold on me  
Each morning I wake to find You near  
You lift me above my fears and set my feet on solid ground  
All of my days belong to You  
And I breathe in Your breath of life that fills my heart  
You are my all consuming fire  
I stand here before You in wide opened wonder  
Amazed at the glory of You  
The power of heaven revealing Your purpose in me  
As Im reaching for You  
I cant believe the way Your love has got a hold on me  
Each morning I wake to find You near  
You lift me above my fears and set my feet on solid ground  
All of my days belong to You  
And I breathe in Your breath of life that fills my heart  
You are my all consuming fire  
And I stand here before You in wide opened wonder  
Amazed at the glory of You  
The power of heaven revealing Your purpose in me  
As Im reaching for You  
And I stand here before You in wide opened wonder  
Amazed at the glory of You  
The power of heaven revealing Your purpose in me  
As Im reaching for You  
And I stand here before You in wide opened wonder  
Amazed at the glory of You  
The power of heaven revealing Your purpose in me  
As Im reaching for You  
And I stand here before You in wide opened wonder  
Amazed at the glory of You  
The power of heaven revealing Your purpose in me  
As Im reaching for You  
Reaching for You  
Reaching for You  
Reaching for You  
And I stand here before You in wide opened wonder  
Amazed at the glory of You  
The power of heaven revealing Your purpose in me  
As Im reaching for You
