Suspicion is your name  
Your honesty to blame  
Put dignity to shame  
Dishonor  
Witch hunt modern day  
Determining decay  
The blatter and disarray  
Disfigure  
The public eyes disgrace  
Defying common place  
Unending paper chase  
Unending  
Deafening  
Painstaking  
Reckoning  
This vertigo it doth bring  
  
Shortest straw  
Challenge liberty  
Downed by law  
Live in infamy  
Rub you raw  
Witch hunt riding through  
Shortest straw  
This shortest straw has been pulled for you  
  
Pulled for you  
Shortest straw  
Pulled for you  
Shortest straw  
Pulled for you  
Shortest straw  
Shortest straw has been pulled for you  
  
The accusations fly  
Discrimination why  
Your inner self to die  
Intruding  
Doubt sunk itself in you  
Its teeth and talons through  
Your living catch twenty two  
Deluding  
A mass hysteria  
A megalomania  
Reveal dementia  
Reveal  
Secretly  
Silently  
Certainly  
In vertigo you will be  
  
Shortest straw  
Challenge liberty  
Downed by law  
Live in infamy  
Rub you raw  
Witch hunt riding through  
Shortest straw  
This shortest straw has been pulled for you  
  
Pulled for you  
Shortest straw  
Pulled for you  
Shortest straw  
Pulled for you

Pulled for you  
Shortest straw  
Pulled for you  
Shortest straw  
Pulled for you  
Shortest straw  
Shortest straw has been pulled for you  
  
Behind you hands are tied  
Your being ostracized  
Your hell is multiplied  
Upending  
The fallout has begun  
Oppressive damage done  
Your many turned to none  
To nothing  
Youre reaching your nadir  
Your will has disappeared  
The lie is crystal clear  
Defending  
Channels red  
One word said  
Blacklisted  
With vertigo make you dead  
  
Shortest straw  
Challenge liberty  
Downed by law  
Live in infamy  
Rub you raw  
Witch hunt riding through  
Shortest straw  
This shortest straw has been pulled for you  
Pulled for you
