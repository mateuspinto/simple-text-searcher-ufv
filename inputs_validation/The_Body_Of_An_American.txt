The Cadillac stood by the house  
And the yanks they were within  
And the tinker boys they hissed advice  
Hotwire her with a pin  
So we turned and shook as we had a look  
In the room where the dead men lay  
So big Jim Dwyer made his last trip  
To the shores where his fathers laid  
  
But fifteen minutes later  
We had our first taste of whiskey  
There was uncles giving lectures  
On ancient Irish history  
The men all started telling jokes  
And the women they got frisky  
At five oclock in the evening  
Every bastard there was piskey  
  
Fare thee well gone away  
Theres nothing left to say  
Farewell to New York City boys  
To Boston and PA  
He took them out  
With a wellaimed clout  
And I often heard to say  
Im a free born man of the USA  
  
He fought the champ in Pittsburgh  
And he slashed him to the ground  
He took on Tiny Tartanella  
And it only went one round  
He never had no time for reds  
For drink or dice or whores  
But he never threw a fight  
When the fight was right  
So they sent him to the war  
  
Fare thee well  
Theres nothing left to say  
With a slainte Joe and Erin go  
My loves in Amerikay  
The calling of the rosary  
Spanish wine from far away  
Im a free born man of the USA  
  
This morning on the harbour  
When I said goodbye to you  
I remember how I swore  
That Id come back to you one day  
And as the sunset came to meet  
The evening on the hill  
I told you Id always love you  
I always did I always will  
  
Fare thee well gone away theres nothing left to say  
Accept to say adieu  
To your eyes as blue  
As the water in the bay  
To big Jim Dwyer  
A man owar who was often said to say  
Im a free born man of the USA  
  
Im a free born man of the USA  
Im a free born man of the USA  
Im a free born man of the USA
