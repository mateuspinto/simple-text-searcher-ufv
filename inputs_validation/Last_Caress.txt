I got something to say  
I killed your baby today  
And it doesnt matter much to me  
As long as its dead  
  
Well I got something to say  
I raped your mother today  
And it doesnt matter much to me  
As long as she spread  
  
Sweet lovely death  
I am waiting for your breath  
Come sweet death one last caress  
  
Go sweet lovely death  
I am waiting for your breath  
Come sweet death one last caress  
  
Well I got something to say  
I killed your baby today  
And it doesnt matter much to me  
As long as its dead  
  
Sweet lovely death  
I am waiting for your breath  
Come sweet death  
One last caress  
  
One last caress sweet death  
One last caress sweet death  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
