We are going to Paris  
in a ship with red sails  
As the storm gathers slowly  
we eat fish heads and snails  
The mate jumps up throws down a line  
to a man overboard for the ninetieth time  
And then he says with a wink  
Sometimes I think  
Ive been doing this forever  
We are going to Paris  
in a ship called the   
There are signs in the sky at night  
that the Captain says hes seen  
I keep books under my pillow  
and read them before I sleep  
Strange places I go to  
strange companies I keep  
We are going to Paris  
we are one and thirty strong  
I can feel it in the air  
well be there before long  
The wind has come  
like a man insane insane  
We are going to Paris  
it rains and it rains  
We are going to Paris  
in a ship with red sails  
We are going to Paris  
in a ship with red sails
