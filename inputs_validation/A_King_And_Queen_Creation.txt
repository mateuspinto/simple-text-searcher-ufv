Lets start the show off sisters ago look alive  
The Queen Latifah the King of 45  
Bringing a mixture of pure flavor  
I make beats she rock rhymes so I gave a  
A sample sound the she added a compound  
Word this is for those who havent heard  
A King and Queen combine minds and trample  
Those who oppose us heres an example  
  
Its time to run the King and Queen is on the set  
The competition is petty and ready to step  
To the first one go ahead rehearse one  
I hope you dont know you sound like the worst one  
Rhymes are smoking concentration cant be broken  
Queen Latifahs outspoken  
Use your imagination picture this  
Any male or female rapper trying to diss  
Here for excitement and enticement  
With my competitors killed I go build with my enlightenment  
Teach the youth feed the needy  
Confident descendant of Queen Nefertiti  
The mother of civilization will rise  
Like the cream and still build the strong foundation  
Secondary but necessary to reproduce  
Acknowledge the fact that Im black and I dont lack  
Queen Latifah is giving you a piece of my mind  
A rhyme spoken by a feminine teacher  
Rhymes I do employ no time for slimy toys  
Im steady and stable and the label is Tommy Boy  
Backed by The Unit produced by The King  
Perfection pressed with the style that we bring  
For the hiphop patients this is a King and Queen creation  
  
Technician musical musician  
Im stating the facts strictly nonfiction  
In hiphop you wonder whos in trouble most  
Creativity you get a double dose  
How can you stop me No I put you to a test  
The rhymes are Romeo The beats a Juliet  
With topic blend this makes me a hard one  
Persevere Im here gets taught one  
Strength producer I send you an ultimatum  
Hardcore worldwide is how I take em  
I rock never hyperventilate  
Others get tired could use a commercial break  
45 King DJ Marks my alias  
It takes a ton of MCs to prevail against me  
Just listen Im unstoppable  
You want a mission This ones impossible  
Beats rock all night with no curfew  
My talents advanced you havent a clue  
How I do it the smoothest loopest spare it  
If the style fits I wear it  
Many attempts were made none was recognized  
45 King said sample soundified  
Im going to Wonderland to check find out whos next  
You pretty good but not quite a legend yet  
Studio mixer I got the formula  
And said the man from self Im warning you  
Its my domain just ask my chauffeur  
My rides equipped everything from a pool to a sofa  
On top its a usual act  
Cant wait to get down to 45 Studios  
Im into rap but no urge to sing  
Im DJ Mark 45 45 King of Swing
