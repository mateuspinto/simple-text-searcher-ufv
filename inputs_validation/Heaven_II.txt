Sometimes I slide away  
Silently  
I slowly lose myself  
Over and over  
  
Take comfort in my skin  
Endlessly  
Surrender to my will  
Forever and ever  
  
I dissolve in trust  
I will sing with joy  
I will end up dust  
Im in heaven  
  
I stand in golden rays  
Radiantly  
I burn a fire of love  
Over and over  
  
Reflecting endless light  
Relentlessly  
I have embraced the flame  
Forever and ever  
  
I will scream the word  
Jump into the void  
I will guide the world  
Up to heaven
