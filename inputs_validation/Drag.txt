Punture me  
Make me feel  
Like I am real  
Torture me  
Drag me under you  
  
Time  
Lifts me up and down  
Time  
Makes me  
Shout  
  
Life is much too short to be  
Intoxicated  
Life is much too short to be  
A drag  
  
Please treat me  
Like I am a fallen angel  
Surpress me  
Tell me  
Lies  
  
Life is much too short to be  
Intoxicated  
Life is much too short to be  
A drag  
  
You cant tell me  
  
Life is much too short to be  
Intoxicated  
Life is much too short to be  
A drag  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Drag  
Drag  
Drag
