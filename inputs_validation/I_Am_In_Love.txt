I am dejected I am depressed  
Yet resurrected and sailing the crest  
Why this elation mixed with deflation  
What explanation I am in love  
  
Such conflicting questions rise  
Around in my brain Should I order cynanide  
Or order champagne  
  
Oh what is this sudden jolt  
I feel like a frightened colt  
Just hit by a thunderbolt I am in love  
  
I knew the odds were against me before  
I had no flair for flaming desire  
But since the gods gave me you to adore  
I may lose but I refuse to fight the fire  
  
So come and enlighten my days and never depart  
You only can brighten the blaze that burns in my heart  
For I am wildly in love with you  
And so in need of a stampede of love  
  
I knew the odds were against me before  
I had no flair for flaming desire  
But since the gods gave me you to adore  
I may lose but I refuse to fight the fire  
  
So come and enlighten my days and never depart  
You only can brighten the blaze that burns in my heart  
For I am wildly in love with you  
And so in need of a stampede of love  
And so in need of a stampede of love
