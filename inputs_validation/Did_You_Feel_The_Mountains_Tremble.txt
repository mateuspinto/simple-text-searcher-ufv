Could this be the land of the free  
Could this be the land of the free  
Let salvations waves crash on these shores again  
And the tide of Your great love come rushing in  
Could this be the land of the free  
  
Did you feel the mountains tremble  
Did you hear the oceans roar  
When the people rose to sing of  
Jesus Christ the risen one  
  
Did you feel the people tremble  
Did you hear the singers roar  
When the lost began to sing of  
Jesus Christ the saving one  
  
And we can see that God Youre moving  
A mighty river through the nations  
When young and old return to Jesus  
Fling wide you heavenly gates  
Prepare the way of the risen Lord  
  
Open up the doors and let the music play  
Let the streets resound with singing  
Songs that bring Your hope and  
Songs that bring Your joy  
Dancers who dance upon injustice  
  
Did you feel the darkness tremble  
When all the saints join in one song  
And all the streams flow as one river  
To wash away our brokenness  
  
And here we that God Youre moving  
A time of jubilee is coming  
When young and old return to Jesus  
Fling wide you heavenly gates  
Prepare the way of the risen Lord  
  
Open up the doors and let the music play  
Let the streets resound with singing  
Songs that bring Your hope and  
Songs that bring Your joy  
Dancers who dance upon injustice
