I cant leave you in the mornin  
When you wake your childs little head looks so appealin  
Walking around in your bunny shoes  
And my pajama tops you see that stay home feelin  
  
I cant leave you in the night  
Cause youre afraid to be alone  
And beg these tears to dry  
I could never leave you cryin  
There must be another way to say goodbye  
  
Every time I try to pack I double up inside  
Just like the cloths Im foldin  
Every empty hanger I put back  
Feels like a cement block my hands are holdin  
  
Honey if its all the same to you  
Id love to stay right here at least till you walk by  
Find an easier way of leavin  
There must be another way to say goodbye  
  
There must be another way to say goodbye make the break  
There must be a bypass round the hurting traffic jam to take  
There must be another way to part  
And come unglued each time we start to try  
There must be another way to say goodbye  
  
There must be another way to say goodbye
