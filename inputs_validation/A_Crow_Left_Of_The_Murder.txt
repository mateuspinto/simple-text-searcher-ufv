Unlearn me  
Ditch what I read  
Behind what I heard  
  
Look Find Free  
Yet Do You get it yet  
Do You get it  
  
From here on its instinctual  
Even straight roads meander  
Every piece contains a map of it all  
It all  
  
Evidence  
In the march of the ants  
Pulse of the sea  
  
Look Find Free  
Yet Do You get it yet  
Do You get it  
  
From here on its instinctual  
Even straight roads meander  
Every piece contains a map of it all  
It all  
  
Out of the line and indivisible  
A crow left of the murder  
Every piece contains a map of it all  
It all  
  
Everything I wanted to know  
Everything I wanted to see  
  
Unlearn Me  
Do You get it yet  
Look Find Free  
Do you get it yet
