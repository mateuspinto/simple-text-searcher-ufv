J bon jovi  
  
I got my call light on  
Gimme one more fare tonight  
Just get me over the bridge  
I can see those shiny bay lights  
You know Im never alone  
But Im feeling lonely tonight  
Damn I got my last cigarette  
But I aint got not light  
  
God let these wheels roll  
To where the girls are pretty  
When the nights explode  
And life is still living  
Down this open road  
The arms of pity  
Wait to greet me tonight in little city  
  
In my rear view mirror  
I see someone elses hairline  
I hear that fire in your eyes  
Is on the rock and doing hard time  
  
And the grapes of wrath theyre on the vine  
Theres wine in this dirt  
Here love aint love  
Its just another four letter word  
  
God let these wheels roll  
To where the girls are pretty  
When the nights explode  
And life is still living  
Down this open road  
The arms of pity  
Wait to greet me tonight in little city  
  
Now that cold gray fogs  
Just a rolling down the highway  
Hes come to carry me home  
Its put a little smile on my face
