Sometimes at night I lay awake  
Just to watch you sleep hear each breath you take  
When the morning lights your face  
I just want to hold you and forget the day  
I live and breathe your every touch  
Do you love me do you love me do you love me that much  
  
When you look at me across the crowded room  
Suddenly I want to be alone with you  
I hang on every word that leaves your lips  
Anticipate the moment when I feel your kiss  
Enough of you is not enough  
Do you love me do you love me do you love me that much  
  
For so long Ive been trying to believe  
That someday youll fall as deep as me  
But its just not there love isnt always fair  
  
Would you want the best for me  
And I hope I find the kind of love you cant feel for me  
Could you find it in your heart  
To end this thing right now before its gone too far  
Let me go and give me up  
Do you love me do you love me do you love me that much  
Do you love me that much
