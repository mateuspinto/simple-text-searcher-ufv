Life was fun  
  
Life was great  
  
Til I made my big mistake  
  
Oh no itll never happen to me  
  
Life was short  
  
And life was sweet  
  
I was thinking as I hit the street  
  
I could hardly believe  
  
I could scarcely conceive  
  
But I had gone out the window  
  
I had gone out the window  
  
I had gone out the window  
  
She was fine  
  
She looked great  
  
And so we made our big mistake  
  
I swear I swear I swear  
  
Itd never happen to her  
  
But the pavement knocked her head around  
  
When she hit the solid concrete ground  
  
From 30 flights above  
  
And she was thirty something loving nothing  
  
Gone out the window  
  
She had gone out the window  
  
She had gone out the window  
  
Catch me if Im falling  
  
Catch me if Im calling  
  
He was smart he was wise  
  
Hed profoundly philosophize  
  
Empathy for all humanity  
  
Til one day by an open window  
  
Theres a note that read  
  
Ive gone out the window Im dead  
  
He said yes to life for all of his life  
  
But then one day he said no  
  
I gotta go out the window  
  
We all go out the window  
  
Catch me I am falling  
  
Catch me I am calling  
  
Catch me we are falling  
  
Catch me we are calling
