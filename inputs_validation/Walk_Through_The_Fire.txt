Walk through the fire  
Through the dust and ashes  
While the building crashes  
Walk through the flame  
No trace of indecision  
Lion keep his vision clear  
Moving out  
Across the water  
The wet leaves quiver in the heat  
Darkness heavy on my shoulder  
Smell the smoke sickly sweet  
The bodys weak the shadows strong  
Walk through the fire  
Through the dust and ashes  
While the building crashes  
Walk through the flame  
Lion show no sign of fear  
Walk through the fire  
Through the dust and ashes  
While the building crashes  
Walk through the flame  
No time for doubt or caution  
Taken by the strong emotion  
Walk through the fire  
No trace of indecision  
Lion hold his vision clear  
Walk through the fire  
Walking in the path of angel  
Walk on down below walk on down below  
Walk on down below walk on down alone
