They lead a lifetime that is comfortable  
They travel far to keep their stomachs full  
They make their living off of arts and crafts  
They kind with seashells driftwood and burlap  
They make a deal when they come to town  
The Sunday swap meet is a battle ground  
She loves him more than he will ever know  
He loves her more than he will ever show  
Keeps his cigarettes close to his heart  
Keeps her photographs close to her heart  
Keeps the bitterness close to the heart
