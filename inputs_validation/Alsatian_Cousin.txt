Were you and he lovers  
And would you say so if you were  
On a forecourt  
On a Friday  
Passing my way  
Oh  
  
Were you and he lovers  
And if you were then say that you were  
On a groundsheet  
Under canvas  
With your tentflap  
Open wide  
  
A note upon his desk  
PS Bring Me Home And Have Me  
Leather elbows on a tweed coat  
Oh  
Is that the best you can do   
So came his reply   
But on the desk is where I want you  
  
So I ask even though I know  
Were you and he lovers
