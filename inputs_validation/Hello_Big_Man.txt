He started a company  
When he was a young man  
Handsome and like a reed so tall  
With a face like an old photograph  
She would fall for him  
Fall for him  
She would fall  
  
She wore her mothers cocktail dress  
With saddle shoes  
She was pretty and she was small  
She worked the switchboard  
Down the hall from him  
Down the hall  
  
Chorus  
He said Hello little woman  
She said Hello big man  
And that was how the wooing  
And the winning began  
He said Hello little woman  
She said Hello big man  
  
Of course New York in those days  
Was carriage rides and matinees  
He took her to a ball  
At the Waldorf Astoria  
He would fall for her  
Fall for her he would fall  
  
Chorus  
  
You could hear them laugh  
As they danced in their room  
And the shadows on the avenue  
Rose into a jealous moon  
Which swung low in the dawn light  
To see what was going on with those two  
  
You keep on expecting  
Something to go wrong  
And nothing does  
They still live in the house  
Where we were born  
Pictures of us kids  
Hanging up all over the walls  
  
And some say he built his empire  
For wealth and fame  
But if you ask him why  
Hell say he did it all for her  
All for her  
All for her  
  
Chorus
