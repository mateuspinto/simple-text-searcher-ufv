Blue Mesa  
Land of the Sioux and Crow  
Blue Mesa  
No matter where I go  
You will always be  
Home sweet home to me  
Blue Mesa  
  
Moonlight shines as  
Purple shadows fall  
Silence broken by the lonesome  
Cototes call on  
  
Blue Mesa  
Land of the Sioux and Crow  
Blue Mesa  
No matter where I go  
You will always be  
Home sweet home to me  
Blue Mesa  
  
Herds of buffalo  
Graze peacefully  
I can almost hear  
Those black hills callin me to  
  
Blue Mesa  
Land of the Sioux and Crow  
Blue Mesa  
No matter where I go  
You will always be  
Home sweet home to me  
Blue Mesa  
  
Ridin high above the prairie floor  
With every passin day  
I swear I love you more  
  
Blue Mesa  
Land of the Sioux and Crow  
Blue Mesa  
No matter where I go  
You will always be  
Home sweet home to me  
Blue Mesa  
  
Blue Mesa  
Land of the Sioux and Crow  
Blue Mesa  
No matter where I go  
You will always be  
Home sweet home to me  
Blue Mesa  
  
You will always be  
Home sweet home to me  
Blue Mesa
