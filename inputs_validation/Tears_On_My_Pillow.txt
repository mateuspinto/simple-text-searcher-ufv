You dont remember me but I remember you  
t was not so long ago you broke my heart in two  
Tears on my pillow pain in my heart caused by you you  
  
If we could start anew I wouldnt hesitate  
Id gladly take you back and tempt the hands of fate  
Tears on my pillow pain in my heart caused by you you you you you  
  
Love is not a gadget love is not a toy  
When you find the one you love hell fill your heart with joy  
  
If we could start anew I wouldnt hesitate  
Id gladly take you back and tempt the hands of fate  
Tears on my pillow pain in my heart caused by you you  
  
No no no no now no no no  
  
You
