There was a time when all I thought that I wanted  
Was someone to touch me  
Like I thought everyone was touched  
What did I know  
What was I thinking  
What did I know  
What was I thinking  
I remember there was someone that I wanted  
Now shes a face  
At the reunion of 66  
What did she know  
What was she thinking  
And did she know  
That I convinced myself I couldnt survive  
Sometimes you have to wait  
Youre pushing but that stone wont move  
And you hesitate to give yourself away  
There was a time when all I thought that I needed  
Was someone to tell me  
I was making a perfect move  
What did I know  
What was I thinking  
What did I know  
What was I thinking  
All I wanted was to hold the attention   
I had a license to tell everyone where its at  
What did they know  
What were they thinking  
And did they know  
That I would only hear the things I desired  
So I would wait  
Im pushing but that stone wont move  
And I hesitate to give myself away  
And there was a time when all I thought that I wanted  
Was to live in a world  
Where everyone knew what love is fore  
What do I know  
What am I thinking  
Nobody knows that the hour is getting late  
So I will wait  
I will wait for it forever  
I will wait  
I will wait for it  
Though I know the hour is getting late
