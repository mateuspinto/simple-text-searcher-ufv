I should get the purple heart for loving you after all the pain you put me
through  
When they start passing medals out to fools I will get the purple heart for
loving you  
  
There was nothing in the headlines to day you won the war  
The one and only casually was me  
You put me out of action so many times before  
And left me on this battlefield to bleed  
And I should get the purple heart  
 steel   
No one knows that Im a hero theres no medals on my chest  
All my wounds are hidden deep inside  
I volunteered to love you hoping for the best  
But all you ever done was cheat and lie  
I should get the purple heart  
I should get the purple heart
