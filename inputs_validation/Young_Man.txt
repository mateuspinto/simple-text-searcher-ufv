people say with age there comes experience  
but as soon as you are born you start to die  
older men are chosen to speak wisely  
but call the child to the sacrificial right  
  
who can we get to win the fight  
young man  
who can we get to make love all night  
young man  
who do we send away to die  
young man  
I heard a lonely woman cry for a  
young man  
  
the fire bombs in distant lands are burning  
jarring every synapse in your soul  
life and death are a meaningless profession  
tomorrow brings a horror yet untold  
  
who can we get to win the fight  
young man  
who can we get to make love all night  
young man  
who do we send away to die  
young man  
I heard a lonely woman cry for a  
young man  
  
young man  
young man  
  
come home my son  
well give you a rest  
welcome my son  
well give you the best  
times stowaway  
the young man  
short are the days  
of the young man  
  
young man  
young man
