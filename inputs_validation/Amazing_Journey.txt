Deaf dumb and blind boy  
Hes in a quiet vibration land  
Strange as it seems his musical dreams  
Aint quite so bad  
  
Ten years old with thoughts as bold as thoughts can be  
Loving life and becoming wise  
In simplicity  
  
Sickness will surely take the mind  
Where minds cant usually go  
Come on the amazing journey  
And learn all you should know  
  
A vague haze of delirium  
Creeps up on me  
All at once a tall stranger I suddenly see  
Hes dressed in a silver sparkled  
Glittering gown  
And his golden beard flows  
Nearly down to the ground  
  
Nothing to say and nothing to hear  
And nothing to see  
Each sensation makes a note  
In my symphony  
  
Sickness will surely take the mind  
Where minds cant usually go  
Come on the amazing journey  
And learn all you should know  
  
His eyes are the eyes that  
Transmit all they know  
Sparkle warm crystalline glances to show  
That he is your leader  
And he is your guide  
On the amazing journey  
Together youll ride
