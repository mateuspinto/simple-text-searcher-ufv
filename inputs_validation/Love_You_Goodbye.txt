He was thinking back when he was a kid  
His folks were divorced  
His old man high on something  
Came knocking at the door  
His mama wouldnt talk to him  
She said boy dontcha let him in  
  
She was cussing and pacing and wasting her life  
On that linoleum floor  
He took him back to his old apartment  
Turned off the TV  
His beautiful broken hero on the couch  
Passed out asleep  
And he put em to bed  
With tears in his eyes  
He said dad I love you goodbye  
  
He headed out into the night  
Seventeen years old  
Fired up that rusty old pickup  
Turned his collar to the cold  
And he headed back to mamas place  
Ready for his big escape  
And he tiptoed up the stairs and left a note  
In the covers fold  
  
It said mom I wish I could wave a wand  
And make you smile again  
Bring back the man who stole your heart  
Fore the demons got to him  
If I stay here any longer  
Something sacreds gonna die  
He said mom I love you goodbye  
  
Took a lot of wrong turns on the road  
Finding his life  
By the grace of God he ended up  
With a little boy and a wife  
And the phone call came from his sister  
It was that old familiar pain  
His mother was at the doorstep  
Of heavens pure white light  
  
At the end of the service  
His father came up to him  
Clear eyed and sober now he said  
Boy Jesus took my sins  
And I pray someday maybe youll forgive me too  
With tears in his eyes  
He said son I love you goodbye  
  
His plane touched down in Texas  
He pulled out his phone  
Dialed in the number got the machine  
Of his old mans home  
He said dad we got an extra room  
And your grandson has your eyes  
Couldnt say anything else  
Cause he started to cry  
And he choked out dad I love you goodbye  
  
Dad I love you goodbye
