Look at that  
Look at this  
Drop a stone in the abyss  
Then walk away and know that anything can happen  
Just like that  
Just like this  
  
Look at that  
Look at this  
Gimme a hug gimme a kiss  
Then hey hey off to school we go  
You might learn something  
Yeah you never know  
  
Look at that  
Look at this  
Lovers merge and make a wish  
They close their eyes and now their dreams are legal  
Over the mountain the eagle flies  
Through clouds of fire  
Swoop and glide  
You cant believe it  
You cant decide  
  
Ask somebody to love you  
Takes a lot of nerve  
Ask somebody to love you  
You got a lot of nerve  
Ask somebody to love you  
Takes a lot of nerve  
Ask somebody to love you  
Ma ma ma ma  
Ma ma ma ma  
Da da da da  
Da da da da  
La la la la  
La la la la  
Oom bop a doom  
  
Look at that  
Look at this  
This is near enough to bliss  
Then over the top we go and down  
Down to the bottom  
If youre looking for worries  
You got em  
  
Ask somebody to love you  
You got a lot of nerve  
Ask somebody to love you  
Takes a lot of nerve  
Tih tih tih tih  
Tih tih tih tih  
Guh guh guh guh  
Guh guh guh guh  
Lih lih lih lih  
Lih lih lih lih  
Oom bop a doom  
  
Come awake come alive  
Common sense we survive  
Then hey hey down the road we go  
You might learn something  
Yeah you never know  
But anyway youve got to go
