There was a shot in the dark  
I was caught by surprise  
There was a hole in my heart  
There were tears in your eyes  
And there was nothing to say  
Cause you made up your mind  
And so I guess what you meant  
When you left was goodbye  
  
So if youre gonna go  
And leave me in a lonely gray  
I wont let it show  
Until you finally float away  
  
You gotta know that you tear me up  
When you say you wanna take it all away take it all away  
You tear it up when you say  
You wanna take it all away take it all away  
You were the one and it was enough  
To be the one you were dreaming of  
You were the one and we called it love  
And now you take it away take away  
  
I felt a pain in my chest with your kiss on my cheek  
And as I tried to digest the words I couldnt believe  
Im left with nothing to say with my heart on my sleeve  
Making it easy to hurt and even harder to breathe  
  
So if you gonna go  
And leave me in the lonely gray  
I wont let it show  
Until you finally float away  
  
You gotta know that you tear me up  
When you say you wanna take it away take it away  
You tear me up when you say  
You wanna take it away take it all away  
You were the one and it was enough  
To be the one you were dreaming of  
You were the one and we called it love  
And now you take it all away take it all away  
You take it all away you take it all away  
  
You gotta know that you tear me up  
When you say you wanna take it all away take it all away  
You tear me up when you say  
You wanna take it away take it all away  
You were the one and it was enough it was enough  
To be the one you were dreaming of dreaming of  
You were the one and we called it love  
And now you take it away take away  
You take it all away you take it all away
