I am hooked on you  
I am ready to go  
I am ready to dance  
Are you  
I wanna see it  
  
Lights turn always like 90 degrees  
Your standing on the wall but baby not me  
Taking center stage come on the floor  
Rolling till I break doing this and more

Your standing on the wall but baby not me  
Taking center stage come on the floor  
Rolling till I break doing this and more  
  
Do it to the floor boy shake  
Do it till the windows break  
The whole room vibrates  
And its like an earthquake  
  
Do it to the floor boy shake  
Do it till the windows break  
The whole room vibrates  
And its like an earthquake  
  
Just lace them shoes tight  
And bring it down to the floor thats right  
Under these lights we working it hard  
I take him back to the hood  
  
Cause Im hooked Im hooked on you  
Im hooked Im hooked on you  
Im hooked Im hooked on you  
On you on you  
  
I say it again like I said it before  
Im in the middle took it to the floor  
Shadows on the wall steam is on my back  
Sweat dripping hard feel it drip drip drop

Sweating until it hurt while the musics loud
