The brightest star on a cloudless night  
Some kind of miracle almost empty sky  
Infact as sure as God is a monkeys dream  
And ate that mushroom and believe what he sees  
  
Trouble with you is you always wanna find the fire  
Sittin warmin your hands by the fireside  
Trouble with you is youre always lookin way outside way outside  
Oh why not enjoy yourself by the fireside  
  
Just as the bite of the blade wakes the absent mind  
Theres time to dream and theres time to open your eyes  
She said just as the warmth of a kiss brings the love alive  
Its right here by the fire where the answers lie  
  
Trouble with you is you always wanna find the fire  
Oh when youre warmin your hands by the fireside  
Trouble with you is youre always lookin far and wide way outside  
Oh why not enjoy yourself by the fireside  
  
She said why you always lookin always lookin  
She said why you always lookin outside  
She said  
  
The trouble with you is youre always lookin for the fire  
When youre warmin your hands by the fireside  
The trouble with you is youre always lookin far and wide way outside  
Oh why not enjoy yourself by the fireside way outside  
  
The trouble with you is youre always lookin somewhere else way outside  
Oh then what you see there beside yourself  
The trouble with you is youre always lookin for the fire way outside  
Oh why not enjoy yourself by the fireside  
Oh why not enjoy yourself by the fireside  
She said oh why not enjoy yourself sittin by the fire  
She said  
The trouble with you  
The trouble with you
