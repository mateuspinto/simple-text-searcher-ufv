My best friend gave me the best advice  
He said each days a gift and not a given right  
Leave no stone unturned leave your fears behind  
And try to take the path less traveled by  
That first step you take is the longest stride  
  
If today was your last day  
And tomorrow was too late  
Could you say goodbye to yesterday  
Would you live each moment like your last  
Leave old pictures in the past  
Donate every dime you have  
If today was your last day  
If today was your last day  
  
Against the grain should be a way of life  
Whats worth the prize is always worth the fight  
Every second counts cause theres no second try  
So live like youll never live it twice  
Dont take the free ride in your own life  
  
Chorus  
If today was your last day  
And tomorrow was too late  
Could you say goodbye to yesterday  
Would you live each moment like your last  
Leave old pictures in the past  
Donate every dime you have  
Would you call old friends you never see  
Reminisce old memories  
Would you forgive your enemies  
Would you find that one youre dreamin of  
Swear up and down to God above  
That you finally fall in love  
If today was your last day  
  
If today was your last day  
Would you make your mark by mending a broken heart  
You know its never too late to shoot for the stars  
Regardless of who you are  
So do whatever it takes  
Cause you cant rewind a moment in this life  
Let nothin stand in your way  
Cause the hands of time are never on your side  
  
Chorus
