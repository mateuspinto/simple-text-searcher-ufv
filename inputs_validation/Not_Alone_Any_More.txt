You always said that Id be back again  
That Id come running to you in the end  
I thought that you were on your own  
And now I find youre not alone  
Chorus  
Ill see you through the rain  
Through the heartache and pain  
It hurts like never before  
Youre not alone any more  
You always said that I would know someday  
Just how it feels when your love walks away  
I let you down I let you go  
I lost you how was I to know  
Chorus  
I never knew I could feel this way  
I never could see past yesterday  
You feel that everything is gone  
I feel it too youre not alone  
Chorus
