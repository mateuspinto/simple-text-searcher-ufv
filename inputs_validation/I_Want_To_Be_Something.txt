4 in the morning  
And my roommates still asnoring  
So I take a walk out on the Boulevard  
  
The wind above me  
Seems to push and pull and shove me  
But it shows me all the places I could fly  
  
I want to be something  
Before I die  
I feel it burning me inside  
  
I want to be something  
I dont know why  
I want to know that at least I tried  
  
I see so clearly  
That the odds are stacked against me  
And that nobody else believes in me at all  
  
Im all alone here  
And I have to face my own fear  
I have no choice but to keep on keeping on  
  
I want to be something  
Before I die  
I feel it burning me inside whoa  
  
I want to be something  
I dont know why  
I want to know that at least I tried  
  
And if my dreams all come true someday true someday  
I wont forget how I feel today I feel today  
Im blown away  
  
I wanna be somethin  
I wanna be somethin  
I wanna be somethin  
I wanna be somethin  
I wanna be somethin  
I wanna be somethin  
I wanna be somethin  
I wanna be somethin  
  
Here I am here I am  
  
I want to be something  
Before I die  
I feel it burning me inside whoa  
  
I want to be something  
I want to feel something  
I want to know that at least I tried
