A gardeners daughter stopped me on my way on the day I was to wed  
It is you who I wish to share my body with she said  
Well find a dry place under the sky with a flower for a bed  
And for my joy I will give you a boy with a moon and star on his head  
Her silver hair flowed in the air laying waves across the sun  
Her hands were like the white sands and her eyes had diamonds on  
We left the road and headed up to the top of the Whisper Wood  
And we walked till we came to where the holy magnolia stood  
And there we laid cool in the shade singing songs and making love  
  
With the naked earth beneath us and the universe above  
The time was late my wedding wouldnt wait I was sad but I had to go  
So while she was asleep I kissed her cheek for cheerio  
  
The wedding took place and people came from many miles around  
There was plenty merriment cider and wine abound  
But out of all that I recall I remembered the girl I met  
Cause she had given me something that my hear could not forget  
A year had passed and everything was just as it was a year before  
As if was a year before  
  
Until the gift that someone left a basket by my door  
And in there lay the fairest little baby crying to be fed  
I got down on my knees and kissed the moon and star on his head  
  
As years went by the boy grew high and the village looked on in awe  
Theyd never seen anything like the boy with the moon and star before  
And people would ride from far and wide just to seek the word he spread  
Ill tell you everything Ive learned and Love is all he said
