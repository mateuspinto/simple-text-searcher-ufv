Waterfall  
Nothing can harm me at all  
my worries seem so very small  
with my waterfall  
  
I can see my rainbow calling me yeah  
through the misty breeze of my waterfall  
  
Some people say dayDreaming is  
for the all the lazy minded fools with nothing else to do  
  
So let them laugh laugh at me  
so just as long as I have you to see me through  
I have nothing to lose long as I have you  
  
Waterfall  
Dont ever change your ways  
fall with we for A million days  
oh my waterfall
