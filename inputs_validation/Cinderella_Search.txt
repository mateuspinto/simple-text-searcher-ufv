On the rebound fumbling all the lines  
The light at the end of the bottle alcoholic alphabet  
Through the looking glass the proof in my own reflection  
Five senses down and reeling on the Cinderella search  
  
On the rebound fumbling all the lines  
Decay on the vertical hold with a horizontal aim  
Conversation needs translation  
Three dimensions down dissolving on the Cinderella search Cinderella search  
  
On the rebound writing all the lines  
Dreaming bartenders bourbon and saxophone  
Out of luck out of charm out the game of rejections in a cigarette city  
Only courting the homing of direction on the Cinderella search Cinderella
search  
  
But the Samaritan of the heartbroken heartbroken  
Swam through the nicotine seize and we exchanged the kiss of life  
Resurrection in a trance the model the Grail in a Marquee of promises  
I touched the dream I hold the dream I have the dream  
  
To end the Cinderella search Cinderella search oh no more no more  
Exposing bedside manners on a work extension  
Awaiting development with paranoid Polaroid eyes Polaroid eyes  
The footman memorised the number  
  
But the prince still holds both the slippers  
And would you leave a palace for a bed sit  
And Canterbury Tales Canterbury Tales  
Maybe it was infatuation or the thrill of the chase  
  
Maybe you were always beyond my reach and my heart was playing safe  
But was that love in your eye I saw or the reflection of mine  
Ill never really know for sure you never really gave me time  
Give me time wont you give me that time  
  
Welcome back to the circus  
Welcome back to the circus  
Welcome back to the circus  
I always use the cue sheets but never the nets  
  
Always the cue sheets but never the nets  
Never the nets never the nets  
Nevertheless nevertheless nevertheless nevertheless nevertheless  
Welcome back to the circus
