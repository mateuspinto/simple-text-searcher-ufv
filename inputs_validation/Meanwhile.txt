She sparkles she dazzles she lights up the room  
We walk together to a table for two  
Every man stares but her eyes are only for me  
We take to the dance floor she squeezes my hand  
I cant believe just how lucky I am  
  
Chorus  
Meanwhile back in the back of my memory  
Youre still dancing with me  
And Im holding you once again  
Meanwhile  
  
We move to the end of a beautiful night  
Tender the kisses soft candle light  
She draws the curtains and slowly we climb up the stairs  
And reach for each other the passion begins  
We fall together as lovers and then  
  
Meanwhile back in the back of my memory  
Youre still lying with me  
And Im holding you once again  
  
I try and I try the Lord knows I do  
But each time my heart beats back to you  
  
Meanwhile Ill go on living my life now  
Ill find a way somehow  
Oh but meanwhile back in the back of my memory  
Youll always be with me  
But Ill never hold you again  
Meanwhile
