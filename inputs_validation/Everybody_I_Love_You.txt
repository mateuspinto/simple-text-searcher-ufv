Know you got to run  
Know you got to hide  
Still there is a great life  
Lingerin deep within your eyes  
  
Open up open up baby let me in  
  
You expect for me to love you  
When you hate yourself my friend  
  
Everybody I love you  
Everybody I do  
  
Though your heart is in anger  
I need your love to get through  
When I tell you I love you  
You can believe that its true  
  
Everybody I love you  
Everybody I do
