The restroom door said gentlemen  
So I just walked inside  
I took two steps and realized  
Id been taken for a ride  
I heard high voices turned and found  
The place was occupied  
By two nuns three old ladies and a nurse  
What could be worse  
Than two nuns three old ladies and a nurse  
  
The restroom door said gentlemen  
It must have been a gag  
As soon as I walked in there  
I ran into some old hag  
She sprayed me with a can of mace  
And smacked me with her bag  
I could tell this just wouldnt be my day  
What can I say  
It was just turning out to be day  
  
The restroom door said gentlemen  
And I would like to find  
The crummy little creep who had the nerve  
To switch the signs  
Cause I got two black eyes  
And one high heel up my behind  
Now I cant sit with comfort and joy  
Boy oh boy  
No Ill never sit with comfort and joy
