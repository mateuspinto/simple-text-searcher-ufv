Angst on the planks spittin from a bridge  
Just to see how far down it really is  
Robbing a bank jumping on a train  
Old antiques a man alone can entertain  
  
It takes all of your power  
To prove that you dont care  
Im not Cordelia I will not be there  
  
Tin can man dragging from a car  
Just to see how alive you really are  
Marrying words falling in your wake  
Just to tell what you cant eliminate  
  
Treading the boards screaming out Macbeth  
Just to see how much bad luck you really get  
Jump in the ring with your hidden cape  
The bull cant decide what it is that he really hates  
  
Angst on the planks spittin from a bridge  
Just to see how far down it really is  
Robbing a bank jumping on a train  
Old antiques a man alone can entertain  
  
Thief lingers on on his hands and knees  
Must be one more thing her I really need  
Die in your dreams falling on your knife  
A Thief blinded on the job has to steal for life
