I slipped on her shoe she was a perfect size seven  
I said theres no smokin in the store maam  
She crossed her legs and then  
We made some small talk thats where it should have stopped  
She slipped me a number I put it in my pocket  
My hand slipped up her skirt everything slipped my mind  
In that little roadhouse On highway 29  
  
It was a small town bank it was a mess  
Well I had a gun you know the rest  
Money on the floorboards shirt was covered in blood  
And she was cryin her and me we headed south  
On highway twenty nine  
  
In a little desert motel the air it was hot and clean  
L slept the sleep of the dead I didnt dream  
I woke in the morning washed my face in the sink  
We headed into the Sierra Madres cross the borderline  
The winter sun shot through the black trees  
I told myself it was all something in her  
But as we drove I knew it was something in me  
Something had been comin for a long long time  
And something that was here with me now  
On highway twenty nine  
  
The road was filled with broken glass and gasoline  
She wasnt sayin nothin it was just a dream  
The wind come silent through the windshield  
All I could see was snow and sky and pines  
I closed my eyes and I was runnin  
I was runnin then I was flyin
