I try to slip myself through try to get to the other side  
I have to patch up the cracks and the holes that I have to hide  
For a little bit of time even maybe it worked okay  
Just long enough to really make it hurt  
When they figured me out and it all just rotted away  
  
Dont you fucking know what you are x3  
go on get back to where you belong  
  
You better take a good look cause Im full of shit  
With every bit my heart and I tried to believe in it  
You can push it all out you can try to pretend  
But you cant change anything you cant change anything in the end  
  
Dont you fucking know what you are x3  
go on get back to where you belong  
  
Dont you fucking know what you are  
  
Remember where you came from  
Remember what you are  
  
Dont you fucking know what you are  
Go on get back to where you belong
