Gonna make my move  
Gonna make it stay  
Gonna make it last  
Nevermind the past  
Living for today  
  
Hey hey Hey hey  
You know what you want me to say  
  
Right right  
Fight fight  
We can start a glorious day  
  
Gonna take a chance  
Gonna rock and dance  
Gonna hit the ground  
With a brand new sound  
Lookin for romance  
  
Hey hey Hey  
You know what you want me to say  
  
Right right  
Fight fight  
We can start a glorious day  
  
Glorious children on my mind  
Glorious wastings of my time  
Glorious friends we make up  
Forcing things in rhyme

Gonna rock it out  
Gonna scream and shout  
Gonna do it right  
Standing in the light  
Flexing all our clout  
  
Gonna do it right  
Standing in the light  
Flexing all our clout  
  
Gonna do it right  
Standing in the light  
Flexing all our clout  
  
Heyeyey
