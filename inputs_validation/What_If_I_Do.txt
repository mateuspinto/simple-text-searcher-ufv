Back and forth that voice of yours keeps me up at night  
Help me search to find the words that eat you up inside  
I go side to side like the wildest tides in your hurricane  
And I only hide what is on my mind because I cant explain  
  
What if I do love  
What if I dont  
Id have to lose everything just to find you  
What if I do love  
What if I dont  
Id have to lose everything just to find you  
  
Its my turn this solo burn so throw me in the fire  
Trophies earned and lessons learned my wicked little lies  
We can pave new roads with the cold creed stones wind them through the pines  
Should I stay or should I go alone I cannot decide  
  
What if I do love  
What if I dont  
Id have to lose everything just to find you  
What if I do love  
What if I dont  
Id have to lose everything just to find you

What if I do love  
What if I dont  
Id have to lose everything just to find you  
What if I do love  
What if I dont  
Id have to lose everything just to find you
