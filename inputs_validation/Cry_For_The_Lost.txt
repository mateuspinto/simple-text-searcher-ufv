Something I forgot that I used to know  
Keeps on coming back around  
Somewhere in the dark right before the dawn  
Like a light from down the hall  
Suddenly some old familiar music  
Songs I know Ive never heard before  
I gotta play along I cant refuse it  
I hear the call  
  
Weve all been so proud of our blindness  
No kindness to share  
  
Chorus  
I used to cry for the lost  
Until I had to turn away  
Then I looked inside past the fool  
And found some deeper words to say  
To bring us together  
  
We can make it better  
We can make it right  
  
We hide behind the veil of our own success  
While were following the rules  
Our eyes refuse to see past our little hands  
To the never changing truth  
Freedom needs to speak a little louder  
Justice needs to try her other arm  
Some of us could push a little harder  
To sound the alarm  
And I see children marching  
And I hear the drums again  
  
I used to cry for the lost  
Until I had to turn away  
Then I looked inside past the fool  
And found some deeper words to say  
If we hope and pray  
It will come give it half a chance  
Everyone understand  
In our hearts and our mind  
You know theres nothing left to hide  
Were already there  
  
I used to cry  
Cry for the lost I was walking away  
I used to try to find a reason  
Then I looked inside  
I used to mind every time I was walking away  
I gotta find what Im feeling  
To bring us together  
  
Chorus Repeats till fade
