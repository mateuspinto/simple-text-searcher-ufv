Oh rapid roy that stock car boy  
He too much too believe  
You know he always got an extra pack of cigarettes  
Rolled up in his tshirt sleeve  
He got a tattoo on his arm that say baby  
He got another one that just say hey  
But every sunday afternoon he is a dirt track demon  
In a 57 chevrolet

Hes the best driver in the land  
He say that he learned to race a stock car  
By runnin shine outta alabam
