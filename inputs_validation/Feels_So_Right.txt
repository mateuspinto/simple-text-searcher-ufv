Perched up like a gargoyle  
Waiting up in a tree  
Dropped down upon a victim  
Fall so silently  
Clown paint with a hoodie  
My face glows at night  
Lurking through shadows  
All feels so right  
Bloodsheds on my arms  
Warm is the feeling  
A Fresh kill is never cold  
But is felt so appealin  
Death in ones eyes  
Illuminates in moonlight  
I stand here a monster  
And it all feels so right  
And it all feels so right  
And it all feels so right  
Round goes the mary  
Scary am I  
Watching her jogging  
Moon in the sky  
Like a spider I wait  
For my sacrifice  
I hate what Im doing but it all feels so right  
I sleep with the bats  
And they tell me stories  
We both feed on death  
And much hated for it  
Sometimes I resist  
But the urge is too tight  
Murders committed and it all feels so right  
And it all feels so right  
And it all feels so right  
One stab for the hungry  
Stab for the we  
One stab for the forgotten  
One stab for the free  
One stab for the laughter  
One stab for the strife  
Bullets rippin through my body  
And it all feels so right  
And it all feels so right  
And it all feels so right  
And it all feels so right  
And it all feels so right  
And it all feels so right
