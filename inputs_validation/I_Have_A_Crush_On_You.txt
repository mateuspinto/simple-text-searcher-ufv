i see her in the shadows  
its not my fault shes showering  
i touch myself because of the way she move  
next she is toweling  
  
ohhh  
is it wrong to watch her  
is it wrong to wanna hold her  
is it wrong to touch myself  
while thinking about her  
  
ohh  
iwant her  
i need her  
she is like a drug  
she makes me feel good  
i need her by my side  
so i can touch her  
my baby  
my queen  
my everything  
  
is it wrong to want  
is it wrong to need  
i touch myself  
it feels so good  
  
i need you back in my life  
you feel me like no other  
  
baby
