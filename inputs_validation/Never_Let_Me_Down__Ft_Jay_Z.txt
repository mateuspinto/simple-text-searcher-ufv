Yo yo first I snatched the street then I snatched the charts  
First had they ear now I have theyre heart  
Rappers came and went Ive been hear from the start  
Seen them put it together watch them take it apart  
  
See the rollers roll up wit ribbons  
I see the we poe we sold then we driven  
So when I reload he holds number one position  
When you hot Im hot and when my feet cold mines is sizzelin  
  
Its plain to see niggas cant fuck wit me  
Cuz Ima be that nigga for life this is not an image  
This is got given this is hard liven  
Mixed wit crystall sippin its the most consistent

I get down for my grandfather who took my momma  
Made her sit that seat where white folks aint wanna us to eat  
At the tender age of 6 she was arrested for the sit in  
With that in my blood I was born to be different  
  
Now niggas cant make it to battles to chose leadership  
But we can make it to jacobs to unverified the dealership  
Thats why I hear new music and I just dun b feelin it  
Racism still alive they just be concealin it  
  
But I know they dont want me in the damn club  
They even made me show I D To get up in to sams club  
I did dirk and went to church and get my hands scrubbed  
That why Ive baptized at least 3 or 4 times  
  
But in the land where niggas pray you cons are getting paid  
It gon take a lot more than coupons to get unverified  
Notin sadder than that day my girl father past away  
So I promised to Mr Rany Im gonna marry your daughter  
  
And you know Id like to thank you for they way that she was brought up  
And I know that you were smiling when you see that car I bought her  
But I cant complaint what the accident did to my left eye  
Cuz look what a accident did to left eye  
  
First Aaliyah and now romeo must die  
I know a got angels watchin me from the other side  
  
When it comes to being truem at least true to me
