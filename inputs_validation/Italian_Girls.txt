At the Turin motor show  
I was dreaming of a mobile  
That couldnt be mine not without lyin  
Was I feeling kind a silly  
When up stepped an unkept filly by the cola machine  
Oh at stand seventeen  
Well she claimed she was a killer  
And she owned a flood lit villa  
A little out the ways from the main highway  
Oh take me way down yonder  
  
She was tall thin and tarty  
And she drove a Maserati  
Faster than sound  
I was heaven bound  
Although I must have looked a creep  
In my army surplus cheap  
Was I being too bold  
Before the night could get old  
No no no no  
She proved me so wrong  
  
Oh the Italian girls sometimes hold their religious habits  
In front of your eyes just to get you tied  
Ah but not my little Bella cause I did not have to tell her  
Id rather you go with the morning sun she made me so tired  
  
She took me way way away down yonder  
Til I was gone with the morning sun on my back  
Gotta get on back there soon as I can  
Take me there  
And I miss the girl so bad  
She broke my heart  
Gotta get on back there soon as I can  
I miss the girl I miss the girl I miss the girl so bad  
I was a lot better off
