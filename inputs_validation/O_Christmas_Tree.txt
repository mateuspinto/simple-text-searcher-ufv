O Christmas tree  
O Christmas tree  
How are thy  
Leaves so verdant  
O Christmas tree  
O Christmas tree  
How are thy  
Leaves so verdant  
Weeee  
  
Not only  
In the summertime  
But even in winter  
Is thy prime  
O Christmas tree  
O Christmas tree  
How are thy  
Leaves so verdant  
  
O Christmas tree  
O Christmas tree  
Much pleasure  
Doth thou bring me  
O Christmas tree  
O Christmas tree  
Much pleasure  
Doth thou bring me  
  
For every year  
The Christmas tree  
Brings to us  
All both joy and glee  
O Christmas tree  
O Christmas tree  
Much pleasure  
Doth thou bring me  
  
O Christmas tree  
O Christmas tree  
Thy candles  
Shine out brightly  
O Christmas tree  
O Christmas tree  
Thy candles  
Shine out brightly  
  
Each bough doth  
Hold its tiny light  
That makes each toy  
To sparkle bright  
O Christmas tree  
O Christmas tree  
Thy candles  
Shine out brightly
