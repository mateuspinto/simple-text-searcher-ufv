Minutes seem like days  
Since fire ruled the sky  
The rich became the beggars  
And the fools became the wise  
Memories linger in my brain  
Of burning from the acid rain  
A pain I never have won  
  
Nothing here remains  
No future and no past  
No one could foresee  
The end that came so fast  
Hear the prophet make his guess  
That paradise lies to the west  
So join his quest for the sun  
  
Shades of death are all I see  
Fragments of what used to be  
  
The world slowly decays  
Destruction fills my eyes  
Harboring the image  
Of a spiraling demise  
Burning winds release their fury  
Simulating judge and jury  
Drifting flurries of pain  
  
Deafening silence reigns  
As twilight fills the sky  
Eventual supremacy  
Daylight waits to die  
Darkness always calls my name  
A pawn in this recurring game  
Humanity going insane  
  
Shades of death are all I see  
Fragments of what used to be  
  
Minutes seem like days  
Corrosion fills the sky  
Morbid dreams of anarchy  
Brought judgment in disguise  
Memories linger in my brain  
Life with nothing more to gain  
Perpetual madness remains  
  
Shades of death are all I see  
Skeletons of society  
Fragments of what used to be  
Skeletons of society
