With your big eyes  
And your big lies  
With your big eyes  
And your big lies  
  
I saw you creeping around the garden  
What are you hiding  
I beg your pardon dont tell me nothing  
I used to think that I could trust you  
I was your woman  
You were my knight and shining companion  
To my surprise my loves demise was his own greed and lullaby  
  
With your big eyes and your big lies  
With your big eyes and your big lies  
  
I noticed you got hot in summer you had no comfort  
Your shirt was cotton your face was sunburned  
You paced around like youd been waiting  
Waiting for something  
Your world was burning and I stood watching  
As I looked on the flames grew high you watched me frown  
I said goodbye  
  
With your big eyes and your big lies  
With your big eyes and your big lies  
  
Is it me was I wrong to have trusted you  
Did I see what I wanted what wasnt true  
Was I wrong to go on like a little fool  
Its amazing what women in love will do  
  
With your big eyes  
And your big lies  
With your big eyes  
And your big lies
