Come my brother come slowly  
Come easy my friend come my friend  
Come my sister come easy  
Come busy on me the youth can depend  
Come my brother put your hands up  
Take your heart out let go come let go  
Come my sister kinda hold ya  
Kinda squeeze ya let go come let go  
Come let go  
Come let go  
Come let go  
Come the winter come summer  
Come autumn come spring do your thing  
Come the river come the mountain  
Come the ocean come the trees you will see  
Come the wind come the rain  
Come the tidal come the tide out again  
Come the wind come the waves  
Come the tidal come the tide out again  
Out again  
Out again
