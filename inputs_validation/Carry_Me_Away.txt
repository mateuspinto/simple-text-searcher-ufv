I called you up today to bridge my sorrow  
Carry me over the line to you  
How long will it take to reach tomorrow  
Seems like a whole lot of time  
Just these thoughts to pull me through  
  
I see blue carpet and cold moonlight settled in  
Voices whisper doubts of how I should have been  
I feel like Im over the water  
But Im caught in the tide  
Tell are you calling for me  
Does this come deep from inside  
Carry me away  
Under the water  
Over the mind  
Carry me away  
Under the water  
Over the mind  
  
The sound slowly fades and trickles away from the sea  
Its only the windows and i  
They hear my dream  
Im walking a distance I feel Ive been running for miles  
Happy times dont last long  
I finally got that its too late to smile  
Carry me away  
Under the water  
Over the mind  
Carry me away  
Under the water  
Over the mind  
Carry me away  
Under the water  
Into your mind
