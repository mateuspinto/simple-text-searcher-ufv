Last time in Paris was a little strange  
Had time to myself  
Headed out to see the city sights  
  
Met a little thing on the ChampsElysees  
Stole my heart away  
You know I never could pronounce her name  
She didnt mind at all  
  
We were sitting there  
Seemed like hours  
Pass the day away  
Till they said we had to pay  
Or do the dishes or something  
I dont know  
  
Living at the plaza Athene  
Got to rest for the show  
Man at the front desk knew my face  
Said he had a room with a view for two  
But he forgot to say  
Renovation next door starts today  
Cant fing another room  
All day long they banged  
14 hours  
  
Show time on my mind  
And wringing somebodys throat  
Last time in Paris  
Last time in Paris  
Last time in Paris was strange  
Last time in Paris  
Last time in Paris  
Last time in Paris was strange  
Overslept missed the bus to the show  
Had to find my own ride  
  
Took the metro out to Avignon  
Man at the backstage didnt know my name  
Said hey Im with the band  
You and everyone today  
  
What is this guy new  
15 minutes fly  
Someone sees me  
  
Inside let me go  
Hey Geoff we need photos  
Before the show  
  
Last time in Paris  
Last time in Paris  
Last time in Paris was strange  
Last time in Paris  
Last time in Paris  
Last time in Paris was strange
