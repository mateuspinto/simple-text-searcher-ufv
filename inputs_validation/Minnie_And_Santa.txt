Worked with a woman named Minnie  
One Christmas eve long ago  
When I asked What you doing this evening   
Minnie took on a seasonal glow  
She said shed be waiting for Santa  
Shed be wearing a bright red bow  
  
Chorus  
  
Minnie And Santa  
Minnie And Santa  
What theyre up to only  
Heaven knows she wrote on a card  
Dont take it so hard were headed for the North Pole  
  
Now Minnie could not be persuaded  
That Santa just did not exist  
She swore if she put up some mistletoe  
Santa did come give her a kiss  
And there where shed hung up her stockings  
All in their silky soft sheen  
Shed be laying in wait on a bear skin rug  
Where the cookies and milk could be seen  
  
Minnie And Santa  
Minnie And Santa  
What theyre up to only  
Heaven knows she wrote on a card  
Dont take it so hard were headed for the North Pole  
  
Now Minnie was older and wiser  
Like a dear old Auntie to me  
But the night that she ran off with Santa  
Was a real epiphany  
  
Minnie And Santa  
Minnie And Santa  
What theyre up to only  
Heaven knows she wrote on a card  
Dont take it so hard were headed for the North Pole  
  
Next Xmas I passed by the bakery  
Staring out from on top of a cake  
Was jolly old Santa with a big silly grin  
And a gal in silk stockings and lace  
Oh Minnie and Santa
