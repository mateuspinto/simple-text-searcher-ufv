Gonna fade my jeans in the deep blue sea  
Wash my cares away  
Feelin the breeze going through the trees  
Just the music of the day  
  
Oh going to Caracas  
Beautiful town when the lights go down  
Dance the night away  
Drinkin the wines  
Make me feel fine  
Thats what the people say  
  
Oh oh Caracas  
Come to the show  
And let yourself go  
Theres magic in the air  
Come a long way to make your day  
Gonna show you that we care  
  
Oh oh going to Caracas  
Oh Im going to Caracas  
  
Almost there got my ticket paid my fare  
Almost there stop us if you dare  
  
Oh oh  
Almost there got my ticket paid my fare  
Almost there yeah stop us if you dare  
  
Gonna fade my jeans in the deep blue sea  
Wash my cares away  
Feelin the breeze going through the trees  
Just the music of the day  
  
Oh oh going to Caracas  
Oh oh going to Caracas
