There is a game I play  
Try to make myself okay  
Try so hard to make the pieces all fit  
Smash it apart  
Just for the fuck of it  
  
Bye bye oooh  
Got to get back to the bottom  
Bye bye oooh  
The big come down isnt that what you wanted  
Bye bye oooh  
Find a place with the failed and forgotten  
Bye bye oooh  
Isnt that really what you wanted now  
  
There is no place I can go there is no way I can hide  
It feels like it keeps coming from the inside  
  
There is a hate that burns within  
The most desperate place I have ever been  
Try to get back to where Im from  
The closer I get the worse it becomes  
The closer I get the worse it becomes  
  
There is no place I can go there is no place I can hide  
It feels like it keeps coming from the inside
