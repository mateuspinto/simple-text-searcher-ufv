Close the door put out the light  
You know they wont be home tonight  
The snow falls hard and dont you know  
The winds of Thor are blowing cold  
  
Theyre wearing steel thats bright and true  
They carry news that must get through  
They choose the path where no one goes  
  
They hold no quarter  
They hold no quarter  
  
Walking side by side with death  
The devil mocks their every step  
The snow drives back the foot thats slow  
The dogs of doom are howling more  
  
They carry news that must get through  
To build a dream for me and you  
They choose the path where no one goes  
  
They hold no quarter  
They ask no quarter
