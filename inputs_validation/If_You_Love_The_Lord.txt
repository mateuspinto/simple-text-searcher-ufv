If you love the lord you will love his will for you  
Instead of questions why therell be praise for all he brings you through  
And if you love the lord you will love his holy commands  
Delight yourself in them and everything you do will surely stand  
  
We are his workmanship created for good works in Christ  
He calls us to offer up ourselves a living sacrifice  
  
Well if you love the lord his discipline you wont despise  
Cause it will prove to you that youre a child in his eyes  
And if you love the lord youll seek his face with all your heart  
And even when youre old from his holy place you wont depart  
  
We are his workmanship created for good works in Christ  
He calls us to offer up ourselves a living sacrifice  
We are his workmanship created for good works in Christ  
He calls us to offer up ourselves a living sacrifice  
We are his workmanship created for good works in Christ  
He calls us to offer up ourselves a living sacrifice  
We are his workmanship created for good works in Christ  
He calls us to offer up ourselves a living sacrifice
