Speaks  
Empty is the sky before the sun wakes up  
Empty is the eyes of animals in cages  
Empty faces of women mourning  
When everythings been taken from them  
Me dont ask me about empty  
  
Sings  
Empty is a string of dirty days  
Held together by some rain  
And the cold winds drumming at the trees again  
Empty is the color of the fear  
Long about September when the days  
Go marching in a line toward November  
Empty is the hour before sleep chills you every night  
And pushes you to take me away from every kind of light  
Empty is me  
Empty is me
