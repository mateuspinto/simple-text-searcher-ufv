There were times I left your heart in pain  
Time again Ive turned and walked away  
I get to where Im going just to find  
Wont be happy in this world  
If youre not by my side  
Ellie my love so sweet  
My heart told me to break away  
Now Im out here far away  
Wish that I could hold you in the night  
Then Id wake up to a morning  
That is warm and bright  
Ellie my love so sweet  
Smile for me wont you baby  
Forever youll be on my mind  
Drink with me wont you baby  
Were gonna make it right this time  
Theres no one else like you  
Anything you want Ill do  
Ellie my love so sweet

My heart told me to break away

Wish that I could hold you in the night  
Then Id wake up to a morning  
That is warm and bright  
Ellie my love so sweet  
Smile for me wont you baby  
Forever youll be on my mind  
Drink with me wont you baby  
Were gonna make it right this time  
Theres no one else like you  
Anything you want Ill do
