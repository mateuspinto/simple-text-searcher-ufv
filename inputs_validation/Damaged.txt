Waiting for the feeling to subside  
Paranoid I melt into myself  
They say Im to reach inside and find  
the broken part of my machinery  
Psychoanalyze the chapters  
on the path to my darkest day  
Searching for the answers  
all I see is damage through the haze  
Picking up the pieces of my life  
with no direction for reassembly  
The one that lays beside me  
is sharing scars of my broken yesterdays  
Will tomorrow find me hypnotized Crying  
Mother Mary in control  
domineering stranglehold  
sowing destructive seeds  
for the scavengers to feed  
Driving the nail into my head  
memory flows like a river  
With the one that lays beside me  
Im healing scars from my childhood memories  
Tomorrow finally found me  
Im hypnotized Im trying  
to understand the chapters  
of the path from my darkest day  
Searching for the answers  
but theres DAMAGE
