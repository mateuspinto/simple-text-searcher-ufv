Billion dollar baby  
Rubber little lady slicker than a weasel  
Grimy as an alley  
Loves me like no other lover  
Billion dollar baby  
Rubber little monster baby I adore you  
Man or woman living couldnt love me like you baby  
  
We go dancing nightly in the attic  
While the moon is rising in the sky  
If Im too rough tell me  
Im so scared your little head will come off in my hands  
  
Billion dollar baby  
I got you in the dime store  
No other little girl could ever hold you  
Any tighter any tighter than me bay  
Billion dollar baby  
Reckless like a gambler million dollar maybe  
Foaming like a dog thats been infected by the rabies  
  
We go dancing nightly in the attic  
While the moon is rising the sky  
If Im too rough tell me  
Im so scared your little head will come off in my hands  
Million dollar baby  
Billion dollar bay  
Trillion dollar baby  
Zillion dollar baby
