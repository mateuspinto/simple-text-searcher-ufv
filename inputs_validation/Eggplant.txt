Scarlet your eyes cover your face  
If I could dance or stay in this place  
I would be King and you would be mine  
I would be day and you would be time  
Eggplant and Caviar for you  
For you for you for you  
Eggplant and Caviar for you  
Hold up my wings cause you are the sky  
Paint me by numbers and dont ask me why  
Cause I am in bloom and you are perfume  
And you are perfume and you are  
Eggplant and Caviar for you  
For you for you for you  
Eggplant and Caviar for you  
For you for you for you  ah  
Apple Pie or Apple seed  
All the mouths that I must feed  
Cold sheets or Tumble weed  
All the ones that I must need  
I would be King and you would be mine  
I would be nine and you would be Mother Time  
Eggplant and Caviar for you for you for you  
Apple Pie or Apple seed  
All the mouths that I must feed  
Cold sheets or Tumble weed  
All the ones that I must need  
All the ones that I must need
