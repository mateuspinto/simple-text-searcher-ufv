If I could hold on  
To just one thought  
For long enough to know  
Why my mind is moving so fast  
And the conversation is slow  
Burn off all the fog  
And let the sun  
Through to the snow  
Let me see your face again  
Before I have to go  
  
I have seen you in the movies  
And in those magazines at night  
I saw you on the barstool when  
You held that glass so tight  
And I saw you in my nightmares  
But Ill see you in my dreams  
And I might live a thousand years  
Before I know what that means  
  
Once there was a friend of mine  
Who died a thousand deaths  
His life was filled with parasites  
And countless idle threats  
He trusted in a woman  
And on her he made his bets  
Once there was a friend of mine  
Who died a thousand deaths
