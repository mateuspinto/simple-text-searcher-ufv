My god sits in the back of the limousine  
My god comes in a wrapper of cellophane  
My god pouts on the cover of the magazine  
My gods a shallow little bitch trying to make the scene  
  
I have arrived and this time you should believe the hype  
I listened to everyone now I know that everyone was right  
Ill be there for you as long as it works for me  
I play a game  
Its called insincerity  
  
Starfuckers  
Starfuckers  
Starfuckers Inc  
Starfuckers  
  
I am every fucking thing and just a little more  
I sold my soul but dont you dare call me a whore  
And when I suck you off not a drop will go to waste  
Its really not so bad you know once you get past the taste yeah  
Ass kisser  
  
Starfuckers  
Starfuckers  
Starfuckers Inc  
Starfuckers  
  
All our pain  
How did we ever get by without you  
Youre so vain  
I bet you think this song is about you  
Dont you  
Dont you  
Dont you  
Dont you  
  
Now I belong Im one of the chosen ones  
Now I belong Im one of the beautiful ones
