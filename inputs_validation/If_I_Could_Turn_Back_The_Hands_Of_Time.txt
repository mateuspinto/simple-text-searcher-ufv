How did I ever let you slip away  
Never knowing Id be singing this song some day  
And now Im sinking sinking to rise no more  
Ever since you closed the door  
  
Chorus  
If I could turn turn back the hands of time  
Then my darlin youd still be mine  
If I could turn turn back the hands of time  
Then darlin you youd still be mine  
  
Funny funny how time goes by  
And blessings are missed in the wink of an eye  
Why oh why oh why should one have to go on suffering  
When every day I pray please come back to me  
  
Chorus  
  
And you had enough love for the both of us  
But I I I did you wrong I admit I did  
But now Im facing the rest of my life alone whoa  
  
Chorus  
  
Id never hurt you If I could turn back  
Never do you wrong If I could turn back  
And never leave your side If I could turn back  
If I could turn back the hands  
  
Thered be nothing I wouldnt do for you  
If I could turn back  
Forever honest and true to you  
If I could turn back  
If you accept me back in your heart I love you  
If I could turn back the hands  
  
If I could turn back  
That would be my will  
If I could turn back  
Darlin Im begging you to take me by the hands  
If I could turn back the hands  
  
Im going down yes I am  
If I could turn back  
Down on my bended knee yeah  
If I could turn back  
And Im gonna be right there until you return to me  
If I could turn back the hands  
  
If I could turn back  
If I could just turn back that little clock on the wall  
If I could turn back  
Then Id come to realize how much I love you  
Love you love you love you  
If I could turn back the hands
