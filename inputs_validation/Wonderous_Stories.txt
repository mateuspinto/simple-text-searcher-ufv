I awoke this morning  
Love laid me down by a river  
Drifting I turned on upstream  
Bound for my forgiver  
In the giving of my eyes to see your face  
Sound did silence me  
Leaving no trace  
I beg to leave to hear your wonderous stories  
Beg to hear your wonderous stories  
  
He spoke of lands not far  
Or lands they were in his mind  
Of fusion captured high  
Where reason captured his time  
In no time at all he took me to the gate  
In haste I quickly checked the time  
If I was late I had to leave to hear your wonderous stories  
Had to hear your wonderous stories  
  
Hearing  
Hearing  
Hearing your wonderous stories  
Hearing your wonderous stories  
It is no lie I can see deeply into the future  
Imagine everything  
Youre close  
And were you there to stand  
So cautiously at first and then so high  
As he spoke my spirit climbed into the sky  
I bid it to return  
To hear your wonderous stories  
Return to hear your wonderous stories  
  
Hearing  
Hearing  
Hearing  
Hearing  
Hearing
