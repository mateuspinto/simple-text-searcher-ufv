Theres been some knocking  
Theres been some heavy knocking  
It sounds like someone wants to break down the door  
My super ego where I go he go  
You come a reaping come a keeping the score and I say  
Lord of karma your mysticpainorama  
One good reason keep my feet on the ground and I say  
Lord of karma your mysticpainorama  
Karma Come on down oh no no  
  
Lord of Karma  
Down on bended knees forever  
Lord of Karma  
Down on bended knees forever  
  
Take fear and loathing and put new clothing on it  
Infatuation with a snow mountain climb  
In limitation and Devils advocation  
Come and make it quick then hit it the ground and I say  
Lord of karma your mysticpainorama  
Karma Come on down oh no no  
  
Lord of Karma  
Down on bended knees forever  
Lord of Karma  
Down on bended knees forever  
Lord of Karma  
Down on bended knees forever  
  
These are the reasons and these are the laws  
In one life youre rich in the next you are poor  
Save your excuses your tensions and fears  
Be sure as you go and you go with the flow  
And you reap what you sow as above so below  
  
Mind your lip and swing your hips  
And be selective be objective  
No pain no gain no pain no gain no pain no gain  
No pain no gain no pain no gain no pain no gain  
No pain  
  
Lord of Karma Repeat x7
