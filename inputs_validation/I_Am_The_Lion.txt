There was a flood and many poor men were killed  
And that is why our house is built on the top of a hill  
The plains are like a friend why cant we live on them  
And if a flood should come why cant we run  
  
I am the lion bellowing out in the night  
We had a cow I left it alone to graze  
And walked to the stream and when I returned it was stolen away  
But now the cow is gone and we dont need a farm  
  
We have not one thing they  
Would steal away  
  
I am the lion bellowing out at the night  
I am the lion bellowing out at the night  
I am the lion
