Whenever a man whenever a man  
Tries to be more like a machine  
He breaks down when I broke down  
I always thought Id go to Calgary  
  
I am I am I am I am in that chair  
Hurtling through space  
Five hundred hundred miles an hour  
And baby it could take  
Forever  
Baby it could take  
Forever  
  
I am I am  
The red light cutting through the clouds  
Roar in I land  
All the secrets hide and come back out  
  
I am I am I am I am in that chair  
Destroying all space  
These are not good hours  
And baby it could take  
Forever  
Baby it could take  
Forever  
  
Calgary to have my heart attack  
Calgary the place to do it its a fact  
Im homing in on your broken glow  
If youre hurting no one would ever know  
  
I am I am I am I am in that chair  
Hurtling through space  
These are not good hours  
And baby it could take  
Forever  
Baby it could take  
Forever  
  
Baby it could take  
Baby it could take  
Baby you could take  
Forever
