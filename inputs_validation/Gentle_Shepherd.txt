Gentle Shepherd  
Show us the way  
Keep us safe  
On the journey  
Give us shelter  
When the day is done  
Lead us out  
Out of the darkness  
Open our eyes  
When the morning comes  
Show us the sun  
  
Gentle Shepherd  
Show us the way  
Grant us mercy  
Hope for tomorrow and  
Strength for a day  
Gentle Shepherd  
Show us your grace  
  
When we fall  
Lift us up Lord  
When we wander  
Bring us home again  
Give us love  
For one another  
Show us your power  
Help us understand  
Merciful friend  
  
Gentle Shepherd  
Show us the way  
Grant us mercy  
Hope for tomorrow and  
Strength for a day  
Gentle Shepherd  
Show us your grace  
Show us your face  
  
Blessed Jesus  
Show us your face
