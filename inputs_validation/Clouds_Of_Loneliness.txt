What can you do Youll never win  
Where will you go when night closes in  
Where will it lead Will it ever end  
Where will it stop  
Losing a friend isnt what we had in mind exactly  
All we need is a friend I guess  
With my midnight star to guide through  
Clouds of loneliness  
You knew someone but was it love  
So many years push came to shove  
You had a dream so they had one too  
You turned away they were untrue  
In our early days we were too willing  
At the time we had yet to arrive  
Many a man and a woman found  
Trying to stay alive  
Where will you go What will you do  
When your whole world aint talking to you  
Maybe you think you will see the light  
Baby its time you hope its right  
And Im all dressed up to be somebody  
All I need is a friendly face  
With my midnight crowd to glide through  
Clouds of empty space  
Seems like every time we turn around  
What we see could be anyones guess  
Many a man and a woman found in  
Clouds of loneliness
