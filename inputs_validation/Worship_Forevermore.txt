Oh Lord  
You have given to me all I need  
And I pray  
For your will to be done  
And I ask  
For your spirit to work in my life  
And that I can  
Be a blessing to you  
Holy one  
Your the light in my darkest day  
Showing me  
The power of your truth  
And I ask  
For the touch of your spirit in me  
Giving me  
The faith to believe  
And I will stand here  
Lost in your love  
And I will worship forevermore  
I will stand here  
Ever amazed  
And I will worship forevermore  
Oh Lord

And I will stand here  
Lost in your love  
And I will worship forevermore  
I will stand here  
Ever amazed  
And I will worship forevermore
