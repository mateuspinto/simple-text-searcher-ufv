Who can know  
The thoughts of Mary Jane  
Why she flies  
Or goes out in the rain  
Where shes been  
And who shes seen  
In her journey to the stars  
  
Who can know  
The reason for her smile  
What are her dreams  
When theyve journeyed for a mile  
The way she sings  
And her brightly colured rings  
Make her princess of the sky  
  
Who can know  
What happens in her mind  
Did she come  
From a strange world  
And leave her mind behind  
Her long lost sighs  
And her brightly coloured eyes  
Tell her story to the wind  
  
Who can know  
The thoughts of Mary Jane  
Why she flies  
Or goes out in the rain  
Where shes been  
And who shes seen  
In her journey to the stars
