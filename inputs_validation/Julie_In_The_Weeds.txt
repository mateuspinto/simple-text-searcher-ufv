Julie lie down in the weeds and see something new  
Something new  
Julie from now on all the pain of youth  
It will not trouble you  
It will not trouble you  
  
North east south west  
No one has a clue  
Nobody quite knows what to do  
  
Julie lie down in the weeds and see  
How I look at you  
How I look at you  
  
North east south west  
No one has a clue  
Nobody quite knows what to do  
  
There are some people  
Who live in order to tell others what to do  
Tell others what to do  
As long as there remains steel in my veins  
They will not trouble you  
They will not touch you  
Will not trouble you
