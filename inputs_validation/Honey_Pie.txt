She was a working girl  
North of England way  
Now shes hit the big time  
In the USA  
And if she could only hear me  
This is what Id say  
  
Honey pie you are making me crazy  
Im in love but Im lazy  
So wont you please come home  
  
Oh honey pie my position is tragic  
Come and show me the magic  
Of your Hollywood song  
  
You became a legend of the silver screen  
And now the thought of meeting you  
Makes me weak in the knee  
  
Oh honey pie you are driving me frantic  
Sail across the Atlantic  
To be where you belong  
  
Will the wind that blew her boat  
Across the sea  
Kindly send her sailing back to me  
  
Honey pie you are making me crazy  
Im in love but Im lazy  
So wont you please come home
