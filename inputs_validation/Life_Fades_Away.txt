My time has come the clouds are calling  
December wind has come my way  
And now I feel the will falling  
All at once its too late  
Life fades away  
  
The night is my wake  
All thoughts slip away  
And even though I must leave you  
Remember I love you  
  
Ill always be in your memory  
And I will always be with you when Im gone  
  
Fade life fades away  
Oh yea yea yea yea  
Life fades away  
  
Im tired of tomorrow  
Lost for today  
I long to be  
At peace forever  
My eternity  
And even though I will miss you  
I must leave you  
  
Fade life fades away  
Oh yea yea yea yea  
Life fades away  
  
So please forgive me  
And try not to cry  
I long to be at peace forever more  
Forever more  
Oh yea yea yea yea  
Yeah yea yea yea yea  
Yeah yea yea yea yea  
Life fades away  
Life fades away  
Life fades away  
Away  
  
One last thing to say  
Life fades away
