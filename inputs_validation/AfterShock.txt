Beats so heavy make my head get hazy  
Big boots make the ground shake crazy  
Body so hot feel like they taze me  
Kill the lights watch the crowd gets shady  
  
Girls getting tricky move round like elastic  
Boys turned on you can see all the static  
Charge it up make it automatic  
Stop the press hear the kick go manic  
  
I feel you move closer to me  
All the signals peaking  
Crank up my electricity  
Till I overload  
  
Lovestruck  
My heart is overheating and it wont stop  
I try to slow the beating but youre so hot  
The tremors keep repeating and I tell myself keep breathing  
But Im caught in your aftershock  
Hit me like an earthquake  
Feel my heaven and earth shake  
Lovestruck  
The tremors keep repeating and I tell myself keep breathing  
But Im caught in your aftershock  
  
Bass so thick you can see the sound wave  
Bubbly spilling like its your birthday  
And comes blasting now make the ground sway  
Put your hands up shout on the replay  
  
I feel you move closer to me  
All the signals peaking  
Crank up my electricity  
Till I overload  
  
Lovestruck  
My heart is overheating and it wont stop  
I try to slow the beating but youre so hot  
The tremors keep repeating and I tell myself keep breathing  
But Im caught in your aftershock  
Hit me like an earthquake  
Feel my heaven and earth shake  
Lovestruck  
The tremors keep repeating and I tell myself keep breathing  
But Im caught in your aftershock  
  
In the aftershock in the aftershock  
In the aftershock in the aftershock  
In the aftershock in the aftershock  
  
Your lips conduct electric flow  
Your kiss vibrates me head to toe  
Your touch is glowing in the dark  
Those neon eyes send me a blaze  
  
Lovestruck  
My heart is overheating and it wont stop  
I try to slow the beating but youre so hot  
The tremors keep repeating and I tell myself keep breathing  
But Im caught in your aftershock  
Hit me like an earthquake  
Feel my heaven and earth shake  
Lovestruck  
The tremors keep repeating and I tell myself keep breathing  
But Im caught in your aftershock  
  
In the aftershock in the aftershock  
In the aftershock in the aftershock  
In the aftershock in the aftershock
