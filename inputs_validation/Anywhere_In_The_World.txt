Verse  
Come with me come with me  
I found a new movement  
Get everybody out on the street  
  
On the street on the street  
I found a new rhythm  
To move our bodies to to the beat  
  
As we move our feet in unison  
Kicking up the rain or the sand in the sun  
It gives my heart that feeling  
Could be anywhere  
  
Chorus  
Anywhere in the world  
Moving like this feeling like this  
Anywhere in the world  
No matter where you are  
  
We could be anywhere in the world  
Moving like this feeling like this  
Anywhere in the world  
No matter where you are  
  
Moving like this feeling like this  
No matter where you are  
  
Verse 2  
Follow me follow me  
To the river where on these streets  
You can discover every part of me  
  
Parts of me part of me  
Many memories make a story  
Come on make another one with me  
  
Yes we clap our hands along with the drum  
Syncing with the pattern like were all part of one  
It gives my heart that good good feeling  
Could be anywhere  
  
Chorus  
Anywhere in the world  
Moving like this feeling like this  
Anywhere in the world  
No matter where you are  
  
We could be anywhere in the world  
Moving like this feeling like this  
Anywhere in the world  
No matter where you are  
  
Moving like this feeling like this  
No matter where you are  
  
Bridge  
Follow me  
Down down to the river  
The sunsets golden  
The water seems silver  
  
Follow me  
Down down to the river  
We could be anywhere in the world  
But were together  
  
Chorus  
Anywhere in the world  
Moving like this feeling like this  
Anywhere in the world  
No matter where you are  
  
We could be anywhere in the world  
Moving like this feeling like this  
Anywhere in the world  
No matter where you are  
  
Moving like this feeling like this  
Anywhere in the world  
No matter where you are
