Met a retarted kid named Greg with a wooden leg  
Snatched it off and beat him over the head with a peg  
Go to bed with a keg wake up with a forty  
Mix it with Alka Seltzer and Formula 44D  
Forget an acid tab Ill strap the whole sheet to my forehead  
Wait until it absorbed and fell to the floor dead  
No more said case closed end of discussion  
We blowing up like spontaneous human combustion  
Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and dramas  
Cross the bombest  
We blowing up your house  
Killing your parents and coming back to get your foster mommas  
Im as good at keeping a promise as Nastradamus  
Cause I aint making no more threats  
Im doing drivebys in tinted Corvettes  
On Vietnam war vets  
I am more or less sick in the head  
Maybe more  
Because I smoked crack today yesterday  
And the day before Sabateur  
Walk the block with a labrador  
Strapped with more straps than El Salvador  
Foul style galore  
Verbal cow manure  
Coming together like an eyebrow on Al B Sure
