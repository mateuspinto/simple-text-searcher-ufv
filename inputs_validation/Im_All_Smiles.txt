Im all smiles darlin  
Youd be too  
If you knew darlin  
All of the smiles were for you  
Im all chills darlin  
Through and through  
But my cold hands darlin  
Warm to the touch of you  
Rain hasnt fallen for days now  
But rainbows are fillin the skies  
My heart must have painted those rainbows  
Shinin before my eyes  
Cant you tell that Im in love darlin  
Deep and true with guess who darlin  
Someone I die for  
Beg steal or lie for  
Eat humble pie for  
Someone to fly  
To the sun moon and sky for  
Someone to live for  
To love with and cry for  
And that someone is you
