He carries his IDs and his books bound in leather  
And a change of clothing and a picture of Anna when she was younger  
Least he forget her and in among his papers is a list of all the people that
he knew  
And many sent letters telling someone that hed be there sometime soon  
Hey stranger arent you the tiredness that remains  
When you think freedom cant be measured  
By the scuffles on your boots hey hey hey  
  
Now he dreams with Anna a life in the time they were together  
He was hard and she was supple where they lived out in the country  
She thought gentle like his hands upon her body  
And when Anna felt the cooling wind David felt the need to be blown down  
And when Anna felt the cleansing rain David fought the fear that he might
drown  
Hey stranger and now you wander through the country  
That you hope is much less frightening when its quicker passing by hey hey
hey  
  
Now in southern Arizona at the Last Chance Diner counter  
Being questioned by the waitress he prepares for the desert  
With his fredom and a canteen of water  
La la la la la la
