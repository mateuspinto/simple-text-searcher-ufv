Send someone to love me  
I need to rest in arms  
Keep me safe from harm  
In pouring rain  
  
Give me endless summer  
Lord I fear the cold  
Feel Im getting old  
Before my time  
  
As my soul heals the shame  
I will grow through this pain  
Lord Im doing all I can  
To be a better man  
  
Go easy on my concious  
Cause its not my fault  
I know Ive been taught  
To take the blame  
  
Rest assured my angels  
Will catch my tears  
Walk me out of here  
Im in pain  
  
As my soul heals the shame  
I will grow through this pain  
Lord Im doing all I can  
To be a better man  
  
Once youve found that lover  
Youre homeward bound  
Love is all around  
Love is all around  
  
I know some have fallen  
On stony ground  
But love is all around  
  
Send someone to love me  
I need to rest in arms  
Keep me safe from harm  
In pouring rain  
  
Give me endless summer  
Lord I fear the cold  
Feel Im getting old  
Before my time  
  
As my soul heals the shame  
I will grow through this pain  
Lord Im doin all I can  
To be a better man
