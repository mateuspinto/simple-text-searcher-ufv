This is the hour when the mysteries emerge  
A strangeness so hard to reflect  
A moment so moving goes straight to your heart  
The vision has never been met  
The attraction is held like a weight deep inside  
Something Ill never forget  
  
The pattern is set her reaction will start  
Complete but rejected too soon  
Looking ahead in the grip of each fear  
Recalls the life that we knew  
The shadow that stood by the side of the road  
Always reminds me of you  
  
How can I find the right way to control  
All the conflicts inside all the problems beside  
As the questions arise and the answers dont fit  
Into my way of things  
Into my way of things
