What goes on in your mind  
I think that I am falling down  
What goes on in your mind  
I think that I am upside down  
Baby be good do what you should you know it will work alright  
Baby be good do what you should you know it will be alright  
  
Im going up and Im going down  
Im going from side to side  
See the bills up in the sky  
Somebodys cut their string in two  
Baby be good do what you should you know it will work alright  
Baby be good do what you should you know it will be alright  
  
One minute born one minute doomed  
One minute up one minute down  
What goes on in your mind  
I think that I am falling down  
Baby be good do what you should you know it will work alright  
Baby be good do what you should you know it will be alright
