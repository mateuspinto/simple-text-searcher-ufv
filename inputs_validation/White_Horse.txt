Say youre sorry  
That face of an angel  
Comes out just when you need it to  
As I paced back and forth all this time  
Cause I honestly believed in you  
Holding on  
The days drag on  
Stupid girl  
I should have known I should have known  
  
That Im not a princess this aint a fairy tale  
Im not the one youll sweep off her feet  
Lead her up the stairwell  
This aint Hollywood this is a small town  
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down  
Now its too late for you  
And your white horse to come around  
  
Baby I was naive  
Got lost in your eyes  
And never really had a chance  
My mistake I didnt know to be in love  
You had to fight to have the upper hand  
I had so many dreams  
About you and me  
Happy endings  
Now I know  
  
Im not a princess this aint a fairy tale  
Im not the one youll sweep off her feet  
Lead her up the stairwell  
This aint Hollywood this is a small town  
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down  
Now its too late for you  
And your white horse to come around  
  
And there you are on your knees  
Begging for forgiveness begging for me  
Just like I always wanted but Im so sorry  
  
Cause Im not your princess this aint a fairytale  
Im gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well  
This is a big world that was a small town  
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now  
And its too late for you and your white horse  
Now its too late for you and your white horse to catch me now  
  
Oh whoa whoa whoa  
Try and catch me now  
Oh its too late  
To catch me now
