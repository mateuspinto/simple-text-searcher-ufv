A man wants to work for his pay  
A man wants a place in the sun  
A man wants a gal proud to say  
That shell become his lovin wife  
He wants a chance to give his kids a better life yes  
Well hello hello hello brother  
  
You can travel all around the world and back  
You can fly or sail or ride a railroad track  
But no matter where you go youre gonna find  
That people have the same things on their minds  
  
A man wants to work for his pay  
A man wants a place in the sun  
A man wants a gal proud to say  
That shell become his lovin wife  
He wants a chance to give his kids a better life  
Well hello brother hello yeah  
  
He wants a chance to give his kids a better life yes  
Well hello hello brother hello  
I said hello hello brother hello
