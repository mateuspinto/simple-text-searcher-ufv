It was that night at nowhere  
I saw you standing there  
Darlin you were hungry for life  
an innocent in this land  
  
What is it about this city  
that brings us all to life  
Ten millions souls vibrating  
Theyre shimmering in the night  
  
You mustnt think of staying  
The price is more than youd think  
Its giving up the sweetest part of you  
For this heartless prize  
  
When does a vision of heaven  
become a living hell  
Ten million souls vibrating  
theyre acting it out for real  
  
Where do all the lonely people go  
When they want some lovin  
Where do all the lonely people hide  
when they feel like cryin  
  
It was that night at nowhere  
a cold glass in your hand  
Darlin you were angry with life  
a prisoner in this land  
  
What is it about this city  
that brings us all to life  
Ten millions souls vibrating  
Theyre shimmering in the night  
  
Where do all the lonely people go  
When they want some lovin  
Where do all the lonely people hide  
when they feel like cryin  
Where do all the lonely people go  
in this crowded city  
Where do all the lonely people hide  
theres no sanctuary  
  
Nowhere to run to nowhere to hide  
Nowhere to handshake nowhere to smile  
Wont you talk with me  
Spend some time and give me life  
When does a vision of heaven  
become a living hell  
Ten million souls vibrating  
Theyre shimmering in the night  
  
Where do all the lonely people go  
in this crowded city  
Where do all the lonely people hide  
theres no sanctuary  
  
A vision of heaven  
A vision of heaven
