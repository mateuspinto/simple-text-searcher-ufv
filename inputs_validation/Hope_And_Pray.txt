I see the headlights  
Shining on the wall  
It seems Ive got a visitor  
Who is kind enough to call  
And I hope and pray everyday  
I hope and pray its you  
I thought I heard some footsteps  
On the floor  
And tell me am I dreaming  
Or is someone at the door  
And I hope and pray everyday  
I hope and pray its you  
Autumn turns to winter  
And winter turns to spring  
I only know the passing  
Of the days  
And if you were to ask me  
Bout the meaning of my life  
It kind of lost its meaning  
On the day you went away  
You know that when it comes  
To matters of the heart  
I thought I had it covered  
But its tearing me apart  
And I hope and pray everyday  
I hope and pray its you  
Autumn turns to winter  
And winter turns to spring  
The summer sun still lingers  
In my head  
If it wasnt for the letters  
That you wrote me from the heart  
Id sometimes wonder baby  
If I dreamed it all instead  
You see Ive got to feel your hand  
Upon my face  
I need to get the calling  
To rejoin the human race  
And I hope and pray every day  
I hope and pray its you  
I hope and pray every day  
I hope and pray its you yeah  
Yeah I hope and pray every day  
I hope and pray its you
