The man and the donkey  
  
Down the road came a tired little donkey  
Much he was loaded till his head hung down  
Upon this back so heavy set a big man  
Singin such a sad song  
As he rode into town  
  
And the man the man sing to the donkey  
But he sing such a sad song and the guitar he broke  
The donkey stop the man he reach to get a big jug  
Him and the donkey take a sip o the drink  
  
Down the road oh the dancing donkey  
Head swingin so high all the pain now gone  
The man he sing some song was a gay song  
And the little donkey kept adancin on  
  
Down the road was the man and the donkey  
So good feel the donkey so gay was the man  
How plain when the wind blow was the sound of the gay song  
When the man and the donkey kept amovin on down the road
