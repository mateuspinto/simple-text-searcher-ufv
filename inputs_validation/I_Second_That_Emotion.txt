Maybe you like to give a kiss so sweet  
Only for one night you belong to me  
Maybe you go away and drive a car  
But the taste of wine is worse than none at all  
  
In that case I dont want no part  
That would only break my heart  
Well if you feel like loving me and if you got the notion  
I second that emotion  
  
Maybe you think that love would tie you down  
You aint got the time to hang around  
Maybe you think that love would make you a fool  
So it makes you wise to break the rule  
  
In that case I dont want no part  
That would only break my heart  
Well if you feel like loving me and if you got that notion  
I second that emotion  
Well if you feel like giving me a lifetime of devotion  
I second that emotion
