A whisper whisper whisper whisper  
A whisper whisper whisper whisper  
  
I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks  
Who remembers your face  
Who remembers you when you are gone  
  
I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks  
Come back and look for me  
Look for me when I am lost  
And just a whisper a whisper a whisper a whisper  
  
Just a whisper a whisper a whisper a whisper  
  
Night turns to day  
And I still have these questions  
Bridges will break  
Should I go forwards or backwards  
Night turns to day  
And I still get no answers  
Just a whisper a whisper a whisper  
A whisper a whisper a whisper  
  
Just a whisper whisper whisper whisper  
I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks  
Who remembers your face  
Who remembers you when you are gone  
  
I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks  
Come back and look for me  
Look for me when I am lost  
And I am just a whisper a whisper a whisper a whisper  
  
Just a whisper a whisper a whisper a whisper  
  
Oh ha ah ah ah ah ah ah
