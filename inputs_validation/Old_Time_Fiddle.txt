I wanna hear an old time fiddle  
Play an old time fiddle song  
I might even drink just a little  
If you play Little Jolie Blon  
If youre lookin or me  
Im liable to be  
In the middle of the ol dance floor  
I wanna hear an old time fiddle  
Like you never get to hear anymore  
  
Chorus  
I wanna throw down on a hoe down  
Hanging with the people I know  
Hear the sweet sound  
Of a breakdown  
When you put a little rosin on the bow  
Yall come on over when the sun goes down  
Bang on the ol screen door  
I wanna hear an old time fiddle  
Like you never get to hear anymore  
  
I miss ol Herman Stover  
Playin Listen To The Mockingbird  
It was Piedmont Oklahoma  
It was the sweetest sound I ever heard  
Skinny ol man in a cowboy band  
You could barely get the people in the door  
I wanna hear an old time fiddle  
Like you never get to hear anymore  
  
I wanna throw down on a hoe down  
Hanging with the people I know  
Hear the sweet sound  
Of a breakdown  
When you put a little rosin on the bow  
Play diggy diggy li  
Diggy diggy lo  
The a little CottenEyed Joe  
I wanna hear an old time fiddle  
Like you never get to hear anymore  
  
Chorus  
  
Yall come on over when the sun goes down  
Bang on the ol screen door  
I wanna hear an old time fiddle  
Like you never get to hear anymore
