Life is a waterfall  
Were one in the river  
And one again after the fall  
  
Swimming through the void  
We hear the word  
We lose ourselves  
But we find it all  
  
Cause we are the ones that wanna play  
Always wanna go  
But you never wanna stay  
  
And we are the ones that wanna choose  
Always wanna play  
But you never wanna lose  
  
Aerials in the sky  
When you lose small mind  
You free your life  
  
Life is a waterfall  
We drink from the river  
Then we turn around and put up our walls  
  
Swimming through the void  
We hear the word  
We lose ourselves  
But we find it all  
  
Cause we are the ones that wanna play  
Always wanna go  
But you never wanna stay  
  
And we are the ones that wanna choose  
Always wanna play  
But you never wanna lose  
  
Aerials in the sky  
When you lose small mind  
You free your life  
Aerials so up high  
When you free your eyes  
Eternal prize  
Aerials in the sky  
When you lose small mind  
You free your life  
Aerials so up high  
When you free your eyes  
Eternal prize
